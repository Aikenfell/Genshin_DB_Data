        "100": "—Nothingness—\n\"Oh my daughter, the one in whom all my hopes are placed! Did I not bring you into existence that you might one day pierce me with a halberd?\" Awakened at last, the God King floated in the heavens to the claps of thunder and the dancing of the wind, rejoicing at his return.\n\nBut she was no longer afraid. This was the moment she had been waiting for her entire life, the moment she had been made for all those eons ago.\nNo — that was not it. The true source of her courage was the time she had spent with him.\n\nThe first Divine Halberd, Irmin, once pierced the Axis Mundi and connected the nine worlds. Now, its replicas had proliferated across the heavens.\n\nFearing the madness that would ensue following his death, the God King made one final Divine Halberd, and named it the Prinzessin der Verurteilung. In this moment, it — nay, she — could finally unleash her true self.\n\n...\n\nA commentary from the editor appears at the end of the book:\n\nLegend of the Shattered Halberd was a successful first attempt by Inazuma's Yae Publishing House to incorporate elements of Liyue culture in one of their novels. The first five volumes were wildly successful, becoming something of a cultural phenomenon in both Inazuma and Liyue. Commercially, the fact that a sixth volume exists at all speaks to its success.\nI trust that the abrupt finale to this epic saga brought by volume six will not be to our readers' displeasure.\nI hope.\n\nThough the ending reads like a different story entirely, I must stress that this did not arise from any attempt on our part to pressurize Mr. Nine, the author, into developing material for a new series. The truth is that in his rush to meet the publishing schedule, Mr. Nine ended up diverging somewhat from his usual style. Mr. Nine simply wished to challenge himself as a writer. ♡\n\nNaturally, we are sympathetic to the fans of the original First Five volumes. In this spirit, we would like to announce that a special First Five collector's edition, the Blackwood Box Set, is currently in the making. Those who have grown up reading Legend of the Shattered Halberd in bookstores: this is the time to finally buy it for yourself! Also, expect to hear more tales of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung in future.\n\nChief Editor, Yae Publishing House",
        "101": "—Moonlight—\nLegend tells of a corner of the city that has been forgotten by the wind.\nTo reach that place one must stand before the fountain and close their eyes, then wait for thirty-five heartbeats, then walk seven circles clockwise around the fountain followed by seven further circles anticlockwise. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...\n\n————\n\n\"Excuse me, is... is anyone there?\"\nVeiga asked timidly as she stepped through the door.\nAs the door closed behind her, the bell that hung from it rang out, its crisp and clear sound filling the room and cutting through the dimly lit drudgery.\nThe dull glow of twilight seeped gently through the frosted glass of the display case windows. Stacks of curious objects filled every part of the room. Veiga made her way through the store cautiously, for fear of stepping on something and breaking it.\nThere was no answer.\nVeiga now began to examine the objects around her more closely: an obscure mechanical component, an ornate ancient lyre, a broken ceramic tile engraved with incomprehensible markings, a pair of old manacles, dented and scratched from years of use, a forgotten crown that once belonged to an aristocrat...\nAt some point as she was inspecting these objects of no apparent utility, the shopkeeper appeared beside her. The shopkeeper's eyes were like those of a fox, with long, slender pupils at their center.\n\"That fang once belonged to a wolf king. Aside from the gods, it is probably the only thing left that remembers that land the way it used to be... every inch of it covered in ice and snow.\"\nShe spoke softly,\n\"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"\n\n\"Do you have anything here that can help someone... to forget?\"\n\"Why, certainly.\"\nVeiga clutched her chest as she pursued the question further.\n\"...To forget anything? Even... someone very important?\"\nThe fox-eyed shopkeeper's expression turned stern, and she nodded as she continued:\n\"I know that the one you wish to forget is a young man with limpid eyes as clear as moonlight. He disappeared a long time ago, and left a deep hole in your heart. Nothing else can fill that hole... all other blessings, no matter how joyful they may be, feel elusive and out of your reach... just like the moonlight before your eyes.\"\nVeiga was stunned into silence. All she could do was nod along.\nThe fox-eyed shopkeeper smiled and, seemingly out of nowhere, presented a bottle of wine.\n\"This wine will help you forget your pain.\"\n\"Long ago in the age when the icy winds blew, our forebears brewed this wine in secret, deep within the frozen earth, to give them the strength to keep surviving. The method they used to brew this kind of wine was forgotten when the people's fate took a turn for the better, and their lives became more joyful.\"\nShe tilted the wine bottle back and forth.\n\"There is not much left. And since it seems you have an affinity with this store, this one is for free. Provided, of course, that this is what you really want...\"\nVeiga took the goblet of wine from the fox-eyed shopkeeper's hand.\nThe goblet must once have been adorned with a precious gemstone. But it had since been removed, and now the only clue to its existence was the empty, lonely indentation it had left behind...\n\nWhen Veiga regained consciousness she was stood in front of the fountain.\n\"Hmm? What am I doing here?\" She wondered to herself. As the moon shone down brightly, she began briskly walking back home. The glow of twilight had all but disappeared now, and if she didn't get back soon...\nShe had forgotten all about the strange store, from the route that had taken her there to everything that had happened inside.\n\n————\n\n\"She's gone.\"\nThe fox-eyed shopkeeper said, after the door had shut and the bell had stopped ringing.\nA young man, one with limpid eyes as bright as moonlight, stepped into view from the back of the store.\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"How many times has she visited now?\"\n\"Six... No, seven. Seven times.\" The young man hesitated for a moment, and then asked, \"Does the wine really work? It's not that I don't trust you, it's just—\"\nThe shopkeeper smiled, though the meaning of her smile was ambiguous.\n\"This wine causes those who drink it to forget their pain. But your shared history is not a painful thing for her. All this wine can do is to help her temporarily forget her longing for you, and the grief of losing you...\"\n\"Whenever she sees the moonlight, she will see you reflected in it, and the memories will start coming back... the time you met at Ludi Harpastum, the afternoon spent beneath the tree at Windrise, the view from Cape Oath, the time you sneaked out of the midsummer celebrations together, hand in hand, the song and the feathered cape you offered to her at the assembly of the traveling bards... All of these are memories she will be reluctant to part with.\"\n\"...I do have another bottle of wine in my shop, one that can make someone truly forget everything. If you wish... I could give her that to drink, instead?\"\nShe smiled slightly as she watched the young man. After a long silence, he let out a sigh.\n\n\"Tell me — why do you insist on leaving her?\"\n\"Ah, well... it's this. This is the reason.\"\nThe young man reached into his breast pocket and took out a spherical object made of crystal. Unknown symbols could be discerned faintly flickering inside it.\n\"I am led to believe that people who receive one of these will one day disappear from this world.\"\n\"If that is so, then the earlier I leave the better. She is still young... if she forgets me now, then she will still have time.\"\n\"Well, well, well...\" sneered the shopkeeper. \"So. You are one of the chosen.\"\n\"It would appear so. But do you... know anything about what happens to the chosen in the end?\"\nThe young man asked eagerly.\nShe forced a smile, but did not reply.\n\"I should be leaving. Now I am the owner of this thing, I suppose I should get on with doing the things that are expected of me.\"\n\"And if she returns? What would you have me do?\"\n\"I think... I think we should leave her to handle it on her own.\"\n\"What a heartless man you are.\"",
        "102": "—Glaze—\nLegend tells of a corner of the harbor that has been forgotten by the mountain rocks and the sound of the crashing waves.\nTo reach that place one must stand in the sea breeze and close their eyes, walk forty-nine steps away from the clamor of the crowds, then wait till the sound of one's own heartbeat drowns out the voices in the background. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...\n\n————\n\n\"Hello? Anyone in?\" Yu'an called out.\nHe tried the door, and let himself in. The bell continued to ring after the door had closed and as he made his way further inside.\nThe faint sound of crashing waves seeped into the store, like a distant memory. Piles of seemingly random artifacts were stacked all the way through from where he stood to the other end of the long and narrow shop. Yu'an looked apprehensively at the range of items throughout the store, somewhat intimidated by the thought of his silken robes being covered in dust that was potentially even older than he.\nOld lanterns made of now-yellowing paper, a giant fang from some unknown monster, brilliant black aerosiderite from the depths of space, a dull gold-colored geometric object built with a mortise and tenon crafted from an unknown material...\nAs he picked up a small bottle filled with a fine white crystalline powder, he heard a soft voice coming from someone who was now stood next to him.\n\"That is salt formed from the residue of an ancient archon's tears—\"\nThe voice caught him off guard, breaking the long silence like a stone disrupts the surface of a pool of still water. Startled, he dropped the bottle he held in his hand.\nBut the sound of smashing glass his ears were anticipating never came. The shopkeeper, who had fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils, had somehow caught the bottle and returned it to its place on the shelf.\n\n\"I'm, er... Huh, I can't remember who it was, but... someone recommended this place to me.\"\nShe gave a slight nod that acknowledged she had heard him, but was ambiguous as to what she thought about it.\n\"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"\n\"I'm looking for a gift for... she's a girl I like.\"\n\"I've been thinking of proposing to her, and I'd like to have a gift to go with it.\"\nYu'an nervously bit his lower lip as he looked up to face the shopkeeper directly. She had mysterious golden eyes that reminded him of Cor Lapis.\nThey looked at each other for a long time in silence. Finally, she spoke: \"Very well.\"\n\nHer slender figure disappeared back into the depths of the store.\nWhen she returned, she held in her hand an object that gave off a faint iridescent glow. On closer inspection, it was revealed to be an exquisitely cut ten-sided illuminating crystal.\n\"I trust you will have heard the legend of the crystal heart?\"\nHe hadn't. But he nodded anyway.\n\"It is made from a variety of crystal called illuminating crystal. Man-made versions exist, but they are pale imitations. True illuminating crystal is capable of revealing the secrets of one's heart, for it is formed from the unfulfilled desire and grief of illuminated beasts of the highest order when they reach the end of their life. Please, take a look...\"\nShe gestured to Yu'an that they should both watch the faintly flashing images emerging from within the crystal.\nTens of thousands of years flashed by before his eyes. Like the continuous shifting of the clouds, stars turned to water and water turned to land. Snow melted and gave way to green pastures. Rivers cut their way through the open country. He watched cities rise like ants' nests and kingdoms topple like toy building blocks...\n\n...The twilight grew dim. Moonlight zigzagged its way across the uneven surface of the ocean. When Yu'an regained consciousness, he found himself walking by the docks.\nThe crystal he held tightly in his hand had become warm, as if blood pulsed through it.\n\"This is a wondrous crystal heart indeed,\" he thought to himself, increasing his pace as he walked on under the moonlight. \"All I need to do is give this to her... Once that's done, then I can... I must...\"\n\n————\n\nThe bell that hung from the door rang out, crisp and clear.\n\"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"\n\"I'd like to exchange this — well, I don't know if it counts as a gemstone, or...\"\nThe finely cut crystal sparkled brightly, scattering rays of light throughout the room.\n\"It was given to me by a man who's been pursuing me. He said that if we looked into it together, we would see many marvelous things.\"\n\"But somehow I just find it makes me feel uncomfortable. It's a beautiful gem, of course, I just... each time I think of him, I get so exasperated. So I wondered if this store would be willing to take it off my hands.\"\n\"I understand. But this is a highly prized ten-sided illuminating crystal. For what quantity of Mora would you be willing to part with it?\"\n\"Actually, I do not want for money. But let me see... what's this — it looks like salt? It's about time I went to Sal Terrae to pay my respects again. If it's okay with you, this is all I need in return for the gem.\"\n\n————\n\nThe fox-eyed shopkeeper sat alone at the back of the shop, turning the geometrically flawless crystal in her hand.\n\"In you, I have seen unpleasant things. That fellow's true nature, it is unbelievable... it is upsetting.\"\n\"That said, when it comes down to it he is but a lowlife opportunist who wishes to marry into a wealthy and prestigious family in the salt industry, and will do whatever is necessary to achieve his wish. Had this not come to light, it is entirely possible that they may still have enjoyed a happy life together, despite it not being born out of genuine mutual affection. After all, happiness is but a state of mind — it is not related to love.\"\nShe took a dainty sip of wine, and smiled mockingly at the thought of her own vanity.\n\"But the fact is, I simply have zero tolerance for people like that.\"\n\"On the other hand, it is delightfully straightforward opening up to a complete stranger. I know that once he sets foot outside that door, we never have to meet one another again — so what does it matter if I reveal a little truth to him? Perversely, the closer two people become, the more one seeks to gain, and so you must be on your guard. But how could he have known...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, this has all been quite the imposition on you. But it is truly wonderful to have this back.\" She lowered her gaze and continued, \"This is, after all, your heart that you have left behind. I will be sure to treasure it... But don't you think it's fun? Taking a trip down into the world once in a while, seeing what people are like nowadays?\"",
        "103": "—Sapphire—\nLegend tells of a corner of the city that has been forgotten by the wind.\nTo reach that place one must stand in the center of the plaza and close their eyes, walk seven circles clockwise around the plaza followed by seven anticlockwise circles, take forty paces forward and then wait till the cries of the birds can no longer be heard in the wind. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...\n\n————\n\nThe shopkeeper, who had fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils, opened the glass double doors to let in the bright moonlight, which seemed to sweep up the stardust from across the night sky and sprinkle it down upon the counter.\nEverything, from the ostentatious flowers, the dust-covered harpastum, and the old books rendered illegible by years of erosion, to the now-stringless old longbow, appeared as the opulent halls of the ruling aristocrats might have done in times of old — covered in a shiny silver coating, though this was a silver that came from the cold light of the night sky.\n\n\"Hey. Business any good these days?\"\nThis audacious alternative to the courteous greeting most people would opt for in the circumstances came from somewhere deep in the back of the shop.\nThe shopkeeper turned around. A familiar customer was sat nonchalantly on her armchair in the part of the shop that the moonlight did not reach.\n\n\"Business is fine. But these days, it would appear, I need to watch out for burglars.\"\nThe shopkeeper responded with a slight smile.\n\"That's it? You're going to turn away your oldest customer, just like that?\"\nThe customer let out a sigh, \"There's nothing in your shop that's worth me spending money on anyway. I mean, if I really had to pick something...\"\n\n\"Well? How was the... hunt?\"\n\"What do you mean? You think I'm just here to offload some loot again?\"\nThe \"hunter\" let out a displeased grunt at the shopkeeper's insinuation. But the shopkeeper continued to smile.\n\"Why, of course not. When have I ever heard you use the word \"loot\" before?\"\n\"On the contrary... all the \"exchanged goods,\" \"free gifts,\" \"philanthropic donations,\" \"bestowals\" and so on that you have so generously given over the years... why, they must make you the most charitably inclined burglar to roam the streets, no?\"\n\n\"Well, that's not why I'm here this time. This time I am here to ask for something from you... the wine. That special wine you've got that helps you forget about the one you long for.\"\nThough a burglar by trade, this customer was nevertheless valiant at heart. His words lacked courtesy, but the smile on his face was entirely earnest.\n\n\"I'm terribly sorry. Somebody has already bought it.\"\nHe looked, and somehow, she was now holding in her hand the wine flask that he had discreetly slipped into his breast pocket earlier.\n\"Each item in this store is spoken for. This particular one has already been bought by a customer who will turn up at some point in the future.\"\n\"It seems your sleight of hand is superior to my own. What a disgrace I am...\"\nThe burglar of valor said with a pained smile.\n\"I discovered recently that the feeling of longing for someone is heavier to carry than gold. In my line of work I am forever leaping between rooftops and running along rafters. I need to cut out whatever... unnecessary weight I can.\"\n\"...I wonder if the girl with the sapphire-blue eyes feels the same weight that I feel?\"\n\n————\n\nSuddenly, the shopkeeper was startled by the jingle of the door bell.\nThe customer who had just arrived was a blue-eyed sorceress with a Pole in her hand and a tall, slender figure to match. The marks on her face bore witness to her persecution by the aristocrats.\nIgnoring the piles of random objects strewn around the store, she marched straight to the counter like a sword lunging toward its opponent's heart.\n\n\"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"\n\"I have an item I wish to exchange.\"\nHer tone sounded cold but fragile, like thin ice in the moment that it shatters. As the sorceress spoke, she placed a giant blue crystal onto the counter.\n\"A burglar pried this from an aristocrat's silver goblet. He gave it to me as a gift, and then I was punished by my master for it.\"\n\"But that was many years ago. I had thought that with the passage of time my anger would be quenched and my desire to see him again would fade away...\"\n\n\"Very well. What sum of Mora do you ask for in return?\"\nThe sorceress gestured toward the tableware cabinet, in which stood an aristocrat's silver goblet with its gemstone missing.\nThe fox-eyed shopkeeper turned the crystal in her hand, flooding the room with the brilliant blue light that reflected off its surface.\n\"I see. Well, provided that this is what you really want...\"\n\nWhen a person encounters a setback, the worry that everything shall come to a fruitless conclusion appears. The advent of fear causes cracks to appear in the mind.\nDeath follows easily in the footsteps of fear, like a damp cold that, to the unprepared, pierces to the bone.\nFor many, it is only in the moment that death is upon them that it dawns on them that their weakness has now been targeted with fatal consequences — and that at some point, therefore, that weakness must have been exposed.\n\nLifting the blue crystal up into the moonlight, the shopkeeper gazed at it intently with her fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils. She watched with delight as the crest of the ruling family came into view, faded out, and came back into view once more.\nLegends claim that peering into a pure gemstone at a specific time can reveal the past, the future, and even someone's true nature. Just as legends claim that somewhere in the world, there is a field of dandelions as vast as the sea. Or that once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon, sisters who were parted by death in a great catastrophe. Or that there was once a witch who could see death before it took place, but in the end herself died from a broken heart, as he who had stolen it from her waited in distant lands longing to see her again.\nOne thing she knew for certain was that even if she were to abandon these objects, the legends attached to them would not disappear, and the way the stories ended could not be undone.\nIn which case, it seemed to make sense to collect all the legends and stories she could in her shop.",
        "104": "—Heart of Stone—\nLegend tells of a corner of the harbor that has been forgotten by the mountain rocks and the sound of the crashing waves.\nTo reach that place one must stand in the sea breeze and close their eyes, walk forty-nine steps away from the clamor of the city streets, then wait until complete silence replaces the sound of the voices in the background, the only remaining sound being that of one's own heartbeat. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...\n\n————\n\n\"Is anybody in?\" The man tapped on the front door as he called out. He was draped in a raincoat.\nHe peered in through the dusty windows at the objects on display around the store — a bottle of glimmering stardust, a broken blade that gleamed like ice, a painting on a roll of paper that the years had turned yellow, an elixir that gave off a mysterious aurora, a tile thinly coated with a gel-like substance...\nHe entered the store. The door closed behind him.\nHe walked over to the counter and began inspecting the weird and wonderful objects in the store. All seemed to be relics from a bygone era. Then, a soft female voice came from beside him.\n\"Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?\"\n\nTaken by surprise, he turned to face the speaker, a fox-eyed shopkeeper, who let out a faint smile.\n\"Here's the thing... I'm looking for a certain something that can help me settle an old score.\"\nThe man spoke with a voice that was clear and resonant, but that had a hint of apprehensiveness about it — one which did not seem to fit with his physical appearance.\n\"Oh? Very well then.\"\nThe shopkeeper's golden fox-like eyes flickered as she examined this new customer of hers who was draped in a soaking-wet raincoat. She gave a nod.\nShe leaned down to search in the bottom of the cabinet. When she stood up a moment later, she was holding a large and beautiful piece of Cor Lapis.\n\nThe Cor Lapis in the shopkeeper's hand gently glowed a dark shade of gold, much in the same way that her eyes did.\nThe man took the stone from her hand and studied it closely in the moonlight. In this light, the Cor Lapis seemed to reveal a deep turbulence concealed within its soft golden hue.\nHis hands were still trembling.\n\n\"Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks. Even the hardest and most resilient of rocks will, over time, eventually produce a pure, limpid soul.\"\nThe shopkeeper's voice seemed to be coming from a distant place. The man gave a nod.\n\"This is precisely what I was looking for.\"\nThe man solemnly responded, and placed a heavy sack of Mora upon the counter. Then, he left the store and ventured off into the midnight rain.\n\n————\n\n\"That's what happened.\"\nAfter the shopkeeper had spoken, she narrowed her fox-like eyes and examined the customer in front of her.\n\"Did he say nothing else at all?\"\nJudging by his appearance, the young man was presumably a miner. His eyes betrayed an urgency that he could not contain. But the shopkeeper responded simply by calmly shaking her head.\n\"He left a sack of Mora with blood stains on the outside.\"\nLike a pool of water, the shopkeeper's voice was calm and still, but also icy cold.\n\n\"That is precisely what I was looking for.\"\nThe young man let out a long sigh. It seemed he wanted to evade the golden gaze of the fox-eyed shopkeeper.\n\"In return, I will give you a story.\"\nThe shopkeeper nodded her head to indicate that he should continue.\n\"That man in the raincoat... I used to go mining with him, up in the mountains. I wanted to make a name for myself. He just wanted to support his family...\"\n\"One rainy night we broke open a rock to find that substantial piece of Cor Lapis inside. The pure golden glow that radiated from its surface was a more breathtaking sight to behold than all the marvels of Jueyun Karst put together...\"\n\"We agreed that we would split it fifty-fifty once we got back to Liyue Harbor. But that night, under cover of the deafening roar of the torrential rain... I discreetly made it so that that clifftop would be his final resting place...\"\n\"I did it because I was scared I couldn't trust him... I couldn't trust in a promise that, aside from ourselves, only the adepti could have heard — and they're probably imaginary anyway.\"\n\"So... Fear won me over. I could bring myself to accept that the whole sum could be mine if I was willing to get blood on my hands, but I couldn't bring myself to accept the risk of traveling with a stranger...\"\n\n\"The following morning, I let down my rope and began my descent down the cliff. I had taken maybe four steps, five or six perhaps, and I was adjusting my footing on a rock when suddenly, I felt the rope trembling in the palms of my hands... Instantly that same trembling permeated every fiber of my being...\"\n\"I lifted my head to look at the rope, but it was too late...\"\n\"The last thing I remember seeing was the torn rope fibers at the end of the snapped rope.\"\n\"Only a hunting knife could have made a clean cut like that. I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Then, in the end, you two settled your score.\"\nThe fox-eyed shopkeeper smiled so faintly it was all but indiscernible.\n\"He takes the Cor Lapis, and you take the whole sum of money for it.\"\nThe young man did not say much in reply.\n\n————\n\nLegends claim that Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks of the earth, and that the stronger the life force of the rock the more power it possesses to reveal a person's true nature.\nSome say that even after its owner has left the world, Cor Lapis will bring their unfulfilled desire and regret back into it, waiting for one with the ability to fulfill them.\nSo the legends claim.\nIt had now been around four hours since the two strange customers had left the store. The rain continued to pour down.\nThe shopkeeper stood by the window for a long time, peering out at the dark street engulfed in misty rain.\n\"But... Is the score truly settled? And are they now truly free? \"\nShe spoke as if posing her question to the curtain of rain, but knowing that the answer would never come.",
        "105": "—Qingxu Pool—\nTo stop me from losing my diary yet again, this time I've put a marker made of moss on the leather case. Now it really stands out in my backpack. It's perfect! Tonight, I'll put it beside my pillow before I go to sleep — there's no way I can lose it then. Honestly, I don't think I can keep calling myself an adventurer if I lose my diary one more time... a misadventurer, perhaps.\n\nI headed westward from the mountain pass at Mt. Tianheng and came to a ruin, known locally as Qingxu Pool. The entrance to the ruin is located right in the center of a giant rocky outcrop rising up from the center of a shallow pool. It is surrounded on all sides by steep cliff faces. There are several stone towers which blend in seamlessly with the natural scenery put here by the Geo Archon. The morning mist is beginning to clear and the first rays of sunlight are starting to illuminate the mountains and ruins. It looks like it'll be good weather today.\n\nLegends say that these ruins predate the Geo Archon's rule over Liyue. The whole of Lisha was covered by water at the time of the Archon War, and back then this rocky outcrop was nothing more than a little islet that rose above the water's surface. After peace was restored, the region of Lisha unfurled once more as the tides withdrew, revealing the ancient buildings erected by the early peoples.\n\nBack when I was at the Wangshu Inn I met a scholar from Sumeru called Soraya. She had done a fair bit of research on the ruins in Lisha. Once she got talking about it she could talk all day. What she told me was that these ruins were left behind by an evil god, whose name has been wiped from the record, and its people. But in the end, the sea gave way to forests and fields, the self-serving god was defeated, and the strongholds and temples of the ancient city the god's people once built were left to crumble. That is how Qingxu Pool came to be. The ruins were submerged until the long Archon War finally came to an end, emerging on the landscape as the tide subsided.\n\nMaybe these crumbling remains have been left as a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era for the adepti and the other deities. In any case, this is a calm and tranquil place that has, for whatever reason, remained entirely unperturbed by the relentless development of Liyue Harbor and untouched by the mining operation based at the Chasm. It has just been left, as-is, right to this day. Perversely, the only disturbances have come since the mining at the Chasm has been halted, as monsters have now occupied the ruins here. Let's just hope they don't destroy anything.\n\nIt is a simple theory, but I need to gather more evidence. I should keep heading north and visit the ruins at Lingju Pass and Dunyu.\n\nI ran into Eduarda again just before I set off. She seemed to be traveling with a partner this time. She must have a busy adventurer's schedule — it seemed like I blinked and then she'd disappeared off into the ruins.",

Suddenly, I knew the answer to that question that had been lingering on my mind for years.\n\"So all the foxes that disappear during the hunt, this is where they hide away.\"\nI thought to myself.\n\"What a beautiful place.\"\nBut when I began teaching the little fox to speak our common tongue, my heart always felt empty, like a wind was blowing inside of me.\nWhen we talked, I would look into her gemstone-lake eyes. In those moments I felt like I was speaking not to the fox, but to a girl I used to love many years ago.\nAnd so, when she was around me, it was as if I were in the presence of the child of someone I had once loved: We had an enjoyable time together, but the experience was somehow tinged with sadness.\nBut the thought of her promise — if I succeeded in teaching her child to speak the common tongue...\n\"I shall impart the magic of transformation to you when the time comes.\"\nRemembering the way she made that solemn promise to me...

I taught him not only our language, but everything I knew in one package, including how to count, how to grow carrots, how to change window panes, and how to sharpen knives.\nWhen it came to rest, we would talk idly.\n\"Why must you learn human speech?\"\nHe answered swiftly:\n\"So that when I transform into a human, I can befriend them!\"\nI continued:\n\"Why would you want to befriend the humans?\"\nHe dropped his gaze.",

        "121": "Under the cascading moonlight, a tearful boy made his wish at the spring.\nA fairy from afar, who had taken up residence in the unoccupied spring, listened in silence to his wordless wish.\n\nSpring fairies know nothing of distant memories or deep dreams. They are born of water's essence, faceless descendants of the angels.\nThus, when the curious fairy emerged from the water and heard the cry of that boy's heart, she became interested in this life, younger and more fragile than her own.\nThe silent fairy reached out her formless fingers, cold as the midnight dew and soft as fortune forgone, and gently caressed the boy's forehead and cheeks.\n\nStartled by this stranger's touch, the young boy lifted his head and met the fairy's gaze.\n\"Can you make my wish come true?\" The boy asked.\nThe fairy of the spring was surprised and confused by this presumptuous question. But she could not speak, and so simply nodded her head.\nSatisfied, the boy left.\n\nHe did not know that the spring fairy was alone, without friends or family, and that she had lost a great deal of her wisdom.\nOnly when the spring water flowed from cracks in the stone into her pool, and when she gazed upon the fractured image of the moon in the rippling water, did she slowly regain the ability to think, and to mimic fragments of speech.\nLike a curious child, the fairy observed the world around her in innocence, wonder, and love. She rejoiced with the fox and squirrel who stole berries, and grieved at the dark clouds that covered the horizon.\n\nAnd for that young boy, a feeling complex yet immature welled forth from within her heart.\nAll alone in this world, she had neither the power nor wisdom with which to grant his wish.\nBut she could share it, and she drew life from sharing his burdens.",
        "122": "As he gazed at the fractured image of the moon carried by the water's ripples, the boy poured his heart out to the spring.\nFrom within his words, she learned much of him.\nAnd from her silence, he strengthened his belief in himself.\n\nDimly, the spring fairy understood that there was good in the world beyond moonlight and fruits, and more to darkness than mere clouds.\nThe boy spoke to her of forests and trees, cities and walls, and shared with her his joys, his sorrows and his fears.\nAs she listened to him, she became enamored of this imperfect world into which she had been born.\n\nWhen the boy grew frustrated at his powerlessness, the spring fairy would gently and quietly wipe away his tears. From them, she grew to understood the world outside the spring a little more.\nThose tears flowed into the water, and the fairy purified them, turning them into a sweet nectar that brought him sweet dreams. The boy forgot the pain of his waking hours, and met the silent fairy by her spring in his sleep.\n\nEvery time that happened, the fairy too would smile, asleep in the pool drenched in moonlight.\nThe fresh dew nourished the boy's dreams, and the boy's dreams rejuvenated the lonely fairy's soul.\nIn those dreams, the spring fairy told the boy tales of the faraway realm of Hydro. She spoke of her sapphire-blue homeland, she sang of the homesickness of exile, and she sighed for separation and belonging. In these dreams, the boy became the one who silently listened, who wept for her troubles, and who rejoiced in her happiness.\n\nOver time, the spring fairy gained the power of speech from the boy's memories and dreams.\nOver time, they became friends who shared all.",

Once youth and innocence had faded, how would he treat his elemental descendants? In the twilight of his life, would he blame himself for throwing his life away for a childish promise?\n\nThe spring fairy was pure and kind, but she did not understand human love. She had never seen the miracle of humanity, and had merely sat idle through millennia of change. And so, she greatly feared parting.\n\nWhat humans see as the miracle of devotion, elemental fairies can only perceive as fleeting pleasure.\nAnd even the power of fairies cannot reverse the aging of a loved one.\n\nThe tender fairy could not bear to see that unavoidable day come, and with a kiss she stopped the boy from uttering the words.\nBut the boy, in his innocence, mistook her rejection as her approval of his promise.\n\nFrom that moment, the fairy vowed that she would someday bear to leave him.\nAnd the boy vowed that he would remain by her spring forever.",

Never again would the fractured moon become whole.\nThe spring fairy suddenly realized that though she had found a place to belong, and though she had experienced fleeting happiness, she was still alone.\n\nThe boy, now no longer a boy, could not perceive her flight, and blamed himself for his own solitude.\n\"Perhaps she was merely a childish fantasy.\"\nHe would think this to himself as he listened to the gurgling of the spring.\n\nBut that cool kiss was real, as was the wind that once played with her hair.\nSuddenly, he realized that though he had met and parted with countless new friends, and though he had adventured and returned more times than he could remember, he was still alone in the end.\n\nSo, as they had done many years ago, the boy's tears fell into the pure pond, soaking into the fractured moon.\nBut this time, the spring fairy did not come as promised.\nStubbornly she turned her back, willing to be the object of an innocent childhood dream, to be a fleeting guest wandering from a foreign land, but unwilling to allow her near-eternal life to break her lover's promise.\n\nLegend has it that whenever the rain pours down, the raindrops that fall into the pond mix with the tears of the spring fairy.\nTo his dying day, the boy believed wholeheartedly in this groundless superstition.\nBut sadly, the spring fairy who fled from her true feelings could never believe it herself.\n",

        "129": "This handbook is a guide on the core principles of the Knights of Favonius. Knights should carefully read the content of this handbook and strictly hold themselves to the standards detailed within in their life and work, serving the people of Mondstadt as a model Knight of Favonius.\n\nAs members of the Knights of Favonius, it is incumbent upon us to be the very embodiment of the three virtues of knighthood: modesty, honesty, and self-control. These are the three pillars of Mondstadt's freedom — remember, freedom cannot exist without the support of duty.\n\nThe direct embodiment of these values comes, of course, in one's everyday speech and actions. Hence, this handbook outlines behavioral standards and language usage prescriptions that are intended to cover all potential scenarios that you may encounter in the course of duty.\n\nSection One\nA knight must exercise vigilance at all times and must never treat any potential threat to Mondstadt lightly. When it comes to your attention that a citizen of Mondstadt is in need, you must come to their aid promptly and willingly, for it is the fundamental duty of the Knights of Favonius to be of service to the people of Mondstadt.\n\nSection Two\nWhen greeting a traveling merchant from a distant land, pay attention to express proper respect and courtesy. Do not exhibit suspicion or hostility towards them, no matter how suspicious they may seem.\n\nApproved Language:\n\"Welcome to Mondstadt, strange yet respectable traveler(s)/wayfarer(s)/guest(s)!* Please state your identity and intended destination. The Knights of Favonius are here to ensure your safety.\"\n*Select the appropriate term of address accordingly.\n\nProhibited Language:\n1. \"Hey, you! Stop right there! State your identity, you rascal(s)/hooligan(s)/ruffian(s)/outlander(s)/trespasser(s)!\"\n2. \"Welcome to the City of Wind and Idylls, otherworldly traveler(s)/vagrant animal(s)/burgeoning storm(s).\"\nNote: Refrain from using vulgar or coarse language. It is especially important never to address the guest using pejorative nomenclature, for this is certain to make them feel most unwelcome indeed.\n\nSection Three\nNever meet members of the public with an attitude of nonchalance or apathy. A responsible knight must always be ready to offer up both sword and sweat for the people's sake. Accordingly, during periods of rest, recreation, or relative inactivity, you must maintain a knightly disposition and be ready to fully re-engage in work matters at a moment's notice.\n\nApproved Language:\n1. (Musing to oneself while on a break) \"I shall check for any previously undiscovered safety issues in Mondstadt — for I, as a knight, have a duty to safeguard Mondstadt at all times.\"\n2. (Conversing with city folk at the tavern) \"As a knight, I am expected to gain an understanding of people's day-to-day needs and concerns. This knowledge is also indispensable to me in the performance of my duties.\"\nNote: Even when there is no work to be done whatsoever, it is not permissible to take a gratuitous amount of downtime at your own discretion.\n\nProhibited Language:\n1. (On active guard duty) \"Imagine having a lifetime's supply of cider...\"\n2. (While taking a break) \"Noeeeelle... Have you got a minute...\"\nNote: The Acting Grand Master has instructed Noelle to immediately report any work-shy knights who attempt to delegate their existing duties to her. It should go without saying that this behavior is entirely unacceptable. Penalties for violations will take the form of reduced vacation allowance and/or salary deductions. The next time that you consider shirking your duties, you are strongly advised to consider whether the consequences are worth it.\n\nSection Four\nWhile the Knights of Favonius respect the important place of wine in Mondstadt's cultural heritage, it is nevertheless expected that knights will exercise due self-control with regard to their alcohol intake. It is not permitted to be drunk while on duty, and it is strictly forbidden to encourage or facilitate the consumption of alcohol by minors.\nNote: Knights of Favonius who are not of legal drinking age are forbidden from consuming alcohol. Accordingly, minors must always be accompanied by an adult coworker when entering taverns and other premises where alcohol is served.\n\nSection Five (New)\nOwing to a recent increase in Fatui activity in the city, knights are reminded that it is forbidden to disclose details of any matters concerning Knights of Favonius operations and strategic deployment to any persons from outside the organization while not on active duty.\n\nSection Six\nIn the event of a major Mondstadt-wide emergency, Knights of Favonius are expected to lead by example and act to safeguard human lives and property. In times of crisis, when people come to you with questions, it is important to answer them clearly and calmly, and to remind them to prioritize their personal safety at all times.\n\nApproved Language:\n1. \"Please, do not worry. The Knights of Favonius will do their utmost to protect Mondstadt!\"\n2. \"When danger is imminent, please do not panic. Cover your head with both hands, and crouch down better protect yourself. Then, follow the instructions given to you by the Knights of Favonius crew, who will lead you to safety in a swift and orderly fashion.\"\n3. (New) \"Please rest assured that even though Grand Master Varka is not currently in Mondstadt, the Knights of Favonius are quite well-equipped to deal with this crisis in a swift and elegant manner.\"*\n*Only applicable during the Grand Master's absence.\n\nProhibited Language:\n1. \"Uh-oh, we've never had to deal with a situation like this before...\"\n2. \"Even the knights are powerless in the face of a crisis of this magnitude...\"\nNote: Even in extreme cases where the crisis is indeed of a kind that has not been seen before, it is imperative that you do not appear overwhelmed in front of members of the public, and that you do not do or say anything to call into question the capabilities of the Knights of Favonius.\n\nSection Seven\nWhen greeting travelers from afar, please act hospitably by informing them of the locations of essential businesses and services, recommending popular tourist destinations, and giving any further assistance that they may request or require.\n\nApproved Language:\n1. \"If it's your first time here, I recommend visiting the Mondstadt Cathedral.\"\n2. \"If you're tired, go have some of Mondstadt's famous wine at a tavern called 'Angel's Share.'\"\n\nSection Eight\nRemember to espouse the virtues of modesty and honesty also in your interactions with coworkers and companions. That is to say, be self-effacing in conversation with comrades, and be open and truthful with them. Nurturing and maintaining a sense of camaraderie and solidarity between all our knights is our first line of defense against the enemy.\n\nApproved Language:\n\"That was wonderful! I've never had a battle experience like that before!\"\nNote: Avoid exaggerating your speech to the point where you become overbearing. Your words and tone should simply express a sufficient degree of respect and cordiality towards your fellow knights.\n\nSection Nine\nAs guardians of Mondstadt serving as the shield of the Anemo Archon, the Knights of Favonius must set an example for others to follow. Under no circumstances should any knight ever violate the rules and regulations of Mondstadt. If any knight is found to have damaged public property* (or the private property of a citizen of Mondstadt) while not on duty, following a damage assessment, an amount equivalent to the damages caused shall be deducted from the salary and/or bonus of the knight in question. Knights who are minors at the time of the violation, and who therefore do not receive a formal salary, will be penalized with solitary confinement in lieu of a fine, with the period of incarceration to be determined based on the severity of the violation.\n*The fish and other aquatic life found in Mondstadt's lakes and rivers are classed as public property, and as such must not be destroyed under any circumstances!\n\nSection Ten\nKnights of Favonius should always remain vigilant and exercise due caution when dealing with strangers. Even when dealing with non-hostiles, a knight should clarify to the stranger their rights and responsibilities as an outsider, explaining the rules and customs of Mondstadt in a firm but fair manner.\n(Amendment 1) Extra scrutiny is required when dealing with visiting diplomats from other nations whose activity gives cause for concern.\n\nSection Eleven\nIn the interests of preventing incidents involving wind glider users, Knights of Favonius should also pay close attention to aerial activity in the region. Knights are required to perform spot-checks on users of wind gliders and ensure that the details therein are current and valid. Should you observe any illegal aerial activity within the city, you should shout to the offender at the top of your voice, imploring them to cease gliding immediately. Should they persist, you should take such further action as is necessary to deescalate the situation.\nNote: Even if the airborne offender is an off-duty member of the Knights of Favonius, this is no cause for leniency. You have full authority to revoke the offending party's gliding license should you deem this to be the appropriate course of action.\n\n\nAppendix: Terminology Notes\n\n1. Knightly virtues\nRefers to the three core virtues of modesty, honesty, and self-control espoused by the Knights of Favonius. The three are mutually reinforcing and treated as a collective. Knights must conduct themselves in accordance with these virtues at all times.\n\n2. Terms of address\nRefers to the various honorifics used to address members of the public, including visitors to Mondstadt. As public servants to the free people of Mondstadt and hosts to others from beyond our borders, we are expected to use the appropriate terms of address in all encounters as an act of courtesy. An education in etiquette is mandatory for all serving knights.\n\n3. Duty\nRefers to our responsibilities to serve the people of Mondstadt and protect the freedom of Mondstadt. Officially appointed Knights of Favonius should refrain from talking flippantly or irreverently about their responsibilities or their honor as a knight in their day-to-day lives, so as to preserve the dignity of our organization's reputation.\n\n4. The Anemo Archon (New)\nThe Anemo Archon Barbatos is the God of Wind and Song, the granter and guardian of Mondstadt's freedom, and the one in whom the people of this land place their faith. As an organization, the Knights of Favonius heeds the will of the Anemo Archon. This means that we must be prepared to go to war in the event that Mondstadt's freedom comes under threat.\nNote: Need to add additional material on this term. Several members of the Knights of Favonius and even the Church seem not to have any belief in the Anemo Archon at all.\n\n5. The Fatui\nDiplomats and other agents of Snezhnaya stationed here in Mondstadt. They are afforded diplomatic immunity within our borders. Their activities are shrouded in mystery and deceit, and their intentions are obscure.\nWarning: Always be wary around members of the Fatui. If you observe any suspicious activity, report it to headquarters immediately while taking care to prioritize your personal safety.\n\n6. The Abyss Order\nAn ancient, mysterious group of enemies from the abyss. No-one knows how they came to be or what they seek. Occasionally, they can be spotted causing trouble near Mondstadt.\nWarning: Members of the Abyss Order are highly dangerous enemies. If you encounter one, exercise extreme caution and report its location and activity to headquarters as soon as possible.\n\n7. Stormterror's Lair (New)\nRefers to the ruins that lie to the northwest of Mondstadt. Legend holds that this area was once a city where a tyrant ruled from his tower. It has since been occupied by Dvalin, who shelters himself there. For this reason, these ruins have now been named \"Stormterror's Lair.\"\n",

        "130": "—Rising Tide—\nAs the moon hung bright among the sea of stars above, hums of a sea shanty slowly began to rise over the waters below.\n\nThere once was a mighty ship that would lay anchor in Liyue Harbor. Its captain was a man who tracked and hunted terrible monsters of the deep, known as the \"Skipper.\"\nThe ships hull was adorned with skeletons of monsters from the sea, an unmistakable signal of their the Skipper's fearless will. However, the shanties of the crew seldom made any mention of hunting creatures of the deep. It's not that the sailors didn't revel in their reputation and brag of their achievements, but ages of navigating the merciless seas had taught them that ballads of blood and water were the most unlucky of all.\n\nWith his sword in hand, the Skipper sailed across the watery expanse, coasting along rocky reefs and cruising with surging undercurrents. He fearlessly guided his ship to face the roar of squalls and sea monsters alike. The dark worlds that laid beneath murky waters were like boundless hunting grounds. Any monster that would dare stir the tranquil waters often became the next trophy hanging from the side of the ship.\n\nBut the Skipper only knew wind and waves, and never seemed to grasp the bittersweet lives of ordinary people. For he occupied all his days with searching and hunting, accompanied solely by the salty sea breeze and the muffled calls of whales in the deep. The crew feared him more than they adored him, ever cautious of his character, relentless as if trying to break free from tangles of seaweed. The Skipper's clipper silently sailed forward, unyielding to the perilous stretches of sea.\n\nOnly the young maiden who always sat atop the towering bow could ever reveal a glimmer of softness to the Skipper's eyes. She was his navigator, charmed by the tidal song and humming with the whales, guiding the ship through the wind and waves to waters infested by beasts.\n\nA young maiden at the helm offered her songs to the sea, paying due respect to its every billow and breeze...\n\n\"Hark the calls of creatures deep, and echoes of waves tossed in the gale.\nWhen the sea and winds flow in our favor, towards the horizon shall we sail.\"\n\"May the deities that have passed, and me ol' captain too,\nSteer our bow through the boundless sea, and point our compass true.\nMay we guide every sailor's soul, to the port they call home.\"\n\nThe chorus of the shanty gave way to the bellowing orders of the Skipper, promptly calling all hands to set sail. The mighty vessel slowly left the port and came underway, sinking into the horizon under the first glimmer of dawn.\n\nThis is how the story of every voyage would begin, just as they had each day before.",
        "131": "—Wild Storm—\n\"Come with me into the watery abyss, listening to murmurs of the deep.\nWhen the wind and waves are right, we sail towards maelstroms of the sea.\nI hear the jabber of me ol' lady, wishing well to her heirs to come:\nMay they navigate blasting winds and o'er dancing waves,\nPierced by heroes' harpoons, may the monster's lair meet the last of its days.\"\n\nEven in the most violent of squalls, her constant shanties never ceased. The voice of the maiden harmonized with the raging waves, guiding the Skipper over deathly currents, sailing boldly towards the eye of the storm where the sea monster lay lurking.\n\nSkimming across the vortex, ushered by lightning and waterspouts, the ship inched further into the monster's treacherous waters. Flashes of lightning revealed the Skipper's silhouette, fearlessly grasping his sword.\n\nFollowing the Skipper's fixed gaze, the crew could only make out an alpine shape shadowed by tenebrous clouds. The massive figure that lay skulking in the distance was the body of the beast. The once fearsome skeletons that hung from the ship now seemed like mere cubs compared with the terrifying silhouette that lay sprawling before them like a mountain range in the center of the maelstrom.\n\nAt the Skipper's bellowing command, the crew fired broadside after broadside of giant crossbows, unleashing their mortal fears and delusions on the massive body they lay like a towering wall before them. The barrages of cannonballs and barbed iron harpoons left gruesome wounds on the body of the beast.\n\nThe sea monster hissed violently in pain, plunging beneath the huge crimson waves before slamming the ship's hull with all its might. The ship nearly capsized against the might of the blow, and crimson waves came crashing across the decks. The sailors were drenched in the foul torrents as they cursed the gods of the elements and continued to rake the body of the beast with stones and sharpened spears.\n\nThe ruthless Skipper never flinched at the opponents dealt to him by fate. The thundering roars of the terrible beast were answered by songs of the young maiden atop the bow. The ship maneuvered round the monster, cruising upon the spinning torrents, and answering sharp fangs and swiping stingers with catapults, harpoons, slings, and even mortal bodies to vent their dread and fury.\n\nOnce the monster's body was riddled with wounds and nearly all its tentacles and claws had been severed, the Skipper's ship too had been reduced to a floating hulk. Half of the ship's masts had fallen, half of its guns were out of action, and half the crew had been taken as dinner for the monster — even the Skipper's prized sword had been cleaved in two. This was an unwinnable bout, much like a mere child challenging a full-grown adult.\n\nThe injured monster knew very well that its opponent no longer posed any threat. Craving to devour the ship that now lay dead in the water, it rose to the surface and exposed its gaping mouth.",

The monster was content with its prey and opened its eyelids, crusted in reef and coral, to witness the final moments of yet another opponent who had underestimated it. The monster's massive eyes revealed their fragile gaze to the dying Skipper.\n\nThe monster reveled the moment and through his pair of eyes beheld a heart that was darker than the abyss.\nA final bolt of lightning flashed in the sky above, illuminating the ship as it split into two among the monster's swirling fangs, fading beneath a mist of splinters. Even the screams from the keel were drowned beneath the waves.\n\nAnd then it was dark again... until the furious roar of the monster broke out over the black waters once more.\n\nThe Skipper plunged his severed sword into the eye of the beast again and again, until he was immersed beneath the filthy tide, when finally his broken sword became lodged in the monster's soft eyeball.\nAs the Skipper drew closer to his treacherous fate, clutched by countless claws and pincers, he continued fighting tooth and nail until the monster's sharp claws were torn into pieces...\n\nA familiar tune then filled the salty breeze as the monster's movements began to cease.\n\n\"Sing with me, farewell to the sea, a shanty I hold so dear,\nWhen the sea and winds flow in our favor, I know my end is near.\nOl' captain is calling me name, back to whence I came,\nSo forget not the captain and I, and hum this melody again.\nThere will come a day when at last you find me, slumbering in the abyssal deep...\nOr perhaps you too then, will be swallowed by the whirlpool in the sea.\"\n\nThe monster's gigantic tentacles burst forth from the water, snaking upwards like towering columns, but the young maiden simply lay there floating on her back, singing amidst the turmoil. Even as the tentacles coiled tightly around her arms, even as the sharp claws pierced her skin, and even as they shredded her clothing to pieces, leaving it floating in tatters on the sea, still she continued to sing her farewell shanty toward the Skipper.\n\nThen, the maiden was gently pulled into the black sea by the monster.\n\nIn an age where the sea was ruled by unpredictable disasters, the people of the waves died each passing day.\nThe Skipper awoke to find himself on the deck of some unknown merchant ship. Having lost his ship and entire crew, all he had left was a body covered in wounds and an old dream echoing an ethereal sea shanty.\n\n\"When the sea and winds are right, I will go forth to sea and avenge her, O maiden charmed by the tidal song...\"",
        "133": "As is known to all, the Lawrence Clan is a noble family of considerable notoriety.\nThe nobles idle away their time, extorting the common folk to furnish their lavish lifestyles.\nThey lead licentious lives. Under their cruel governance, countless unspeakable crimes are committed against the people.\nAlthough the common folk unanimously resent the nobles' greed, they are powerless to speak a single word against them.\n\nYoung Dietrich was a highborn noble.\nHe hadn't yet committed any deplorable crimes at his tender age. In fact, his swordsmanship was reputedly exceptional among the noble circles.\nIf you wished to find something to cavil about, it would have been his short temper and chronic delusion that the whole universe revolved around him. Such traits, of course, are not uncommon among the sons of nobility, so it wasn't of any major concern.\nHowever, given that he was born into the Lawrence family name, it was only a matter of time before he would get drafted into the ranks of the other scoundrels.\n\nIt was at this time that the young scoundrel decided upon the first reckless act of his life.\nA short while earlier, Dietrich had made up his mind to skip the Grand Mage's discourse on the elements in favor of a bit of fun outside the confines of the city. As he pressed his way through the streets crowded with commoners, his gaze fell upon a young lass with blonde hair and blue eyes.\nDietrich was at a loss for words for the emotions that bubbled in his heart at that moment. The only thing he was certain of was that his heart had never thumped so loudly, or so uncontrollably, within his chest.\n\"So this must be how dear Mother feels when she sees her kitty.\"\nAs Dietrich kept thinking in his heart, he suddenly found himself moving towards where she was standing.\n\nMuch to his dismay, the young commoner girl didn't so much as bat an eyelid at him. After making his identity known too her, she didn't display even the slightest sign of any interest.\nConvinced that this commoner didn't understand what was good for her, he decided that he would carry her off under the cover of night.\n\n\"Once I take her, I'll lock her away in a cage, just like dear Mother would when her kitty is being naughty.\"",
        "134": "The plebeian lass arrived in the city on one fine sunny day. Her long golden hair shone like the spring sunshine, and her blue eyes sparkled like the gleaming waves in the afternoon sun. It's hard to imagine how such a girl could travel alone from the monster infested outskirts all the way to the city.\n\n\"To call her suspect would only be an insult to her beauty!\"\nThus shouted the drunken gate sentry among the clamor of the crowded tavern. His earnings from guarding the gate that day were especially bountiful, enough to keep his cup brimming until dawn at least.\n\"We all know you were just dumbstruck by her beauty!\"\nThe man next to him pulled no punches.\n\"Hah, what do you know! Do I look like one to go frolicking after ladies? I'll show you what I really have my eye on!\"\nThe soldier promptly pulled out his money purse and shook it in his hand.\n\"Good heavens! Today, drinks are on you!\"\n\"You heard the man, drinks all around! I'm just worried that one more will be one too many for ya!\"\n...\n\nSo this traveling scholar who went by the name of Nottie settled into her newfound life in the city.\nNottie spoke in a quiet, gentle manner. A rumor eventually began floating around the streets claiming that if you exchanged a few words with Nottie during the day, you would have sweet dreams the following night.\nApart from this, the new girl didn't disturb the lives of those in the city in any manner. After all, the people not only had their daily lives to deal with, but also the constant oppression from the nobility.\n\n\"Oh, I thought life in the city would be simple. I never imagined it would be like this...\"\nAs rays of sunset filled her room, she tilted her head and rested it on her hands. Sitting beside the table, her fingers seemed to be circling around something. Her words flowed like a magical chant with the power to persuade people into believing almost anything.",
        "135": "Night came.\nThe faint howl of a wild beast could be heard echoing in the distance. It seemed to be the cry of a wolf.\nNottie sat on her bed and lifted her long sleeves to reveal a bone-white armband carved in the fashion of a coiling snake.\nThe serpent's head was strikingly lifelike with its mouth stretched open to reveal its fangs. Its neck was reared back as if ready to pounce on its prey the very next moment.\nThe snake's slithering body was wrapped around her arm, emitting a dangerous aura under the rays of the magical lamps that lit the room.\n\"Goodnight, my dear sister.\"\nNottie gently petted the armband, rubbing her pinkie playfully along the snake's tail.\nShortly after, the magic lamps went out and the entire room was draped in darkness.\n\nThe darkness of night brought Nottie boundless power.\nSo Nottie was already wise to the unknown presence the moment it entered the room.\nSitting on the bed, Nottie could clearly see Dietrich as he quietly gathered her clothes and felt his way around in the dark.\nIt became harder and harder for Nottie to hold back her laughter, until Dietrich was just in front of her.\n\nDietrich met the same dazzling eyes that occupied his mind all day.\nBut her eyes were somehow different now. They were no longer blue like water as Dietrich had seen that day. At this moment, they were filled with the night, devoid of waves, tranquil like the depths of the sea.\n\n\"Here, drink the water in this cup.\"\nThat was the last thing Dietrich heard before his consciousness faded away.",
        "136": "The cup fell from his languid hand as Dietrich collapsed to the floor.\nNottie crouched beside Dietrich and relieved him of the saber sheathed upon his waist.\nShe stroked the hilt of the blade for a moment before pulling back her hand, and a black gemstone that had been inlaid in the hilt fell into her palm.\n\n\"How convenient... You have brought the Eye of Eternal Night right to me. Thank you.\"\nRemoving the snake armband as she spoke, she placed the black gemstone in the mouth of the snake.\nScales and flesh began to quickly ripple from the snake's head down its body. A small black snack uncoiled in Nottie's hands, slithering off her palm and falling to the floor. The snake began to enlarge, forming into a massive python with red eyes and black scales, its twisting body almost filled the whole room.\nNottie extended her hand and as the magical lamps illuminated the room, the python began to shrink down again and coiled back around her arm.\n\n\"Hmm? Are you hiding?\"\nNottie turned her gaze to beneath the bed.\nUnder which she found...\nA dog.\nIt was trembling uncontrollably, probably frightened by the python a moment before.\n\n\"Oh, what a pity. I wanted to turn you into a wolf, but it seems you turned into a dog instead!\"\nAlthough Nottie's words seemed to be apologizing, her voice lacked any hint of remorse.\n\nDietrich still hadn't realized what had happened yet. It was only by pure instinct that he had scurried under the bed.\nOnly then did he begin to come to his senses. He tried to say something after hearing Nottie's words, but no matter how hard he tried, only \"woof woof woof\" would come out.\nAfter hearing himself, Dietrich panicked and dashed out from under the bed.\n\nNo matter how many times Dietrich leaped in front of the mirror, or how many times he howled in disbelief, the reflection of a striking young noble never appeared again.\nDietrich then turned with a snarl and leaped towards Nottie. Without even being the least bit startled, she simply glanced at him with folded arms. Suddenly Dietrich could no longer move toward her, no matter how hard he tried.\n\n\"That's not the proper etiquette for addressing a lady. Hmm... It seems you need to be trained!\"",
        "137": "\"Allow me introduce myself again. I am Nottfriga, but perhaps you're more familiar with my nickname. People call me the Enchantress of the Night.\"\nAs she spoke, her long golden hair began to gradually darken, eventually turning black as the night sky outside the window. Her once sky-blue eyes were now pitch-black, ushering in the darkness of night.\n\n\"I am your master now. Of course, I will need to train you well.\"\nNottfriga knelt down and placed a necklace that seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the still struggling Dietrich. The necklace shrank in size until it fit perfectly around his furry neck. No matter how he thrashed his head about or clawed at it, the necklace would not budge.\n\n\"Tsk, we've already wasted so much time. Come, we're leaving.\"\nWith that, Nottfriga set off towards the city. Dietrich whimpered along the way with all the strength he could muster, wishing he could simply run back to his villa. But he couldn't, no matter how hard he tried. The necklace Nottfriga had placed on him seemed to somehow control him, so he had no choice but to follow behind her.\n\nNottfriga glanced back at the reluctant Dietrich dawdling behind her, and curled a strand of her hair around her finger.\n\"Although it is certainly amusing to watch you struggle in your current state, you are much too noisy. So unless you'd like a taste of my new Silence of the Night spell, you'd better keep your yapping mouth shut.\"\nThe whole world seemed to fall into silence at that moment. Intuition told Dietrich that it'd be best not to become the latest test subject for Nottfriga's new spell.",
        "138": "Between the rustling emerald curtains of foliage, in a spot where the croaks of frogs and shrills of cicadas meet, lies a corner of the forest that is withered and dry, just near the wetlands beneath the mountain crags.\n\nThe bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce is the verdant home to many fables.\n\nAfter a spell of rain, a cadence of drips and drops could be heard bouncing from the bamboo leaves and hollow bamboo stalks. Along a winding path between the bamboo spires came a young boy. He swiftly made his way along the trail, climbing up damp crags and running down its paved mossy course. The leaves of tangled foliage and vines strewn across his path brushed against his skin. The boy finally decided to stop for a rest at a dried and withering spot among the creaking bamboo of Mt. Qingce, tucked away below the mountain rock.\n\nThe boy clearly remembered the village elder once saying that the rainy season was the proper time for the fox to take its wife. Only the eyes of a child could ever see the fox bride's crimson sedan chair and its procession dancing through the forest accompanied by strains of music and thumping drums.\n\nThe village elder also warned that kids mustn't approach any such procession.\n\n\"If you wander too close, the fox will snatch your soul away!\"\nThat's what the village elder always said.\n\"What happens if your soul gets snatched?\" asked one of the kids.\n\"Once the fox has your soul, your fate will be forever sealed... Perhaps they will use you for music in their processions, smashing you like a cymbal and beating you like a drum, horns blaring all around... There will be no rest for your soul.\"\nThe elder would never forget to pose as if she were beating a drum while she spoke, scaring the little ones all the more.\n\nAs the boy grew older, he stopped believing the elder's silly fables. Following the Seelie's wispy trails, he passed through the green labyrinth, accompanied by the faint calls of foxes coming from the thickets along the way. Those crafty creatures hiding deep in the forest will seldom reveal themselves or their boisterous bridal processions to careless treading travelers.\n\nThe boy was in rather low spirits, kicking pebbles off the road and stomping up the naturally occurring stone steps along the way, wandering further into the heart of the bamboo forest.\n\nThe village elder once said that this very forest was once an ancient kingdom conquered by the Geo Archon. But what did the Geo Archon look like? Did it have arms and legs, or eyes like us? Or, was he more like the stone beasts found along the water banks?\n\nThe herb gatherers that periodically set up shop in the city to sell their herbal ingredients would always bring tales of that year's Rite of Descension. Listening to their stories, one could only imagine the amazing scene of the Geo Archon descending to the world. But of course, the curious kids could only hope to someday see the great Archon that had been revered for generations with their very own eyes. \n\nWas the immovable Mt. Qingce a gift from the benevolent Geo Archon? And were the decades of peace and the long lives that had been enjoyed by generations of people here preordained by the Archon?\n\nThe answers to these questions lay outside the village, within the aging forest on the mountain.\n\nBubbling with questions and expectation, the determined boy made his way forward beneath the scattered shadows of bamboo leaves.",
        "139": "Lost among the green bamboo canopy, the young lad soon met an unexpected companion.\n\n\"What's the matter? Are you lost?\"\nThe lad heard a gentle voice among the rustling bamboo stalks, speaking with a hint of sarcastic playfulness.\n\nThe lad turned to see a slender woman garbed in white. She stood beside a clear babbling brook, with beads of water glistening on her woven rush raincoat, her golden eyes melding with the rays cast through the forest by the setting sun.\n\nThe village elder had said that there were once white horses that would leap from clear springs to become adepti to assist the campaigns of the Lord of Geo.\nBut no one had ever specified which spring, or the honorable name of the illuminated beast that sprang from it.\nBesides, the woman that stood before him now didn't appear to be an adeptus, apart from the piercing gaze of her golden eyes.\n\nFurthermore, he had never heard of any adepti that needed to wear raincoats.\n\n\"Well if it isn't another fool.\"\nThe lady garbed in white began to chuckle, squinting her eyes with a smile. \n\n\"Who are you calling a fool?\"\nReplied the young lad in a fluster.\nThis was certainly no adeptus. Who had ever heard of an adeptus that would speak in such a deplorable manner?\n\n\"I wish to embark on an adventure. I want to sail across the seas and witness the stone spears of the Lord of Geo for myself!\"\n\n\"You've only just embarked on your journey and yet you've already fallen astray among the bamboo forest...\"\nThe woman's reply was calm and even, a subtle smirk playing over her eyes. Already, the lad found her particularly annoying.\n\n\"I don't need your...\"\n\"There's no shame in being lost. Come, follow me. I will lead out of here.\"\nThe woman snickered and extended her slender hand toward the boy. Her white skin glimmered under the rays of the sunset that shone between the bamboo leaves.\n\n\"Uh, thank you...\"\nThe young lad took her outstretched hand. Her skin was cold and damp to the touch, much like fresh rain upon a mountain or dewdrops upon a bamboo shoot.\n\nThe setting sun gradually disappeared behind the mountain ridge, and the afterglow in the clear sky above gradually grew dim.\n\nThe village elder always used to say that once the warm glow of the setting sun fades, the cold and murky atmosphere of the mountain woods becomes a perfect breeding ground for monsters.\nThese monsters are born from a past that has long gone, their spirits forming from the resentment and unwillingness of the dead. Any bamboo they ensnare will dry up and die, and any person they ensnare will similarly grow weary and fade from existence.\n\"Sometimes, they will even call upon passers-by to assist them with matters that they could not accomplish on their own, before leading them into a trap from which they would never return...\" \n\"Other times, they would act as a guide for innocent travelers, leading them to a den of demons.\"\n\"So you see, little ones, you must stay vigilant, and never let your guard down when you journey far from familiar soil.\"\nThus would say the village elder, patting the kids on their heads as she finished the story.\n\nCome to think of it, could this woman in white be a monster of the mountain woods?\nThe lad grew nervous in his heart and couldn't help but slow his pace.\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\nThe woman turned around, her golden eyes shining through the moonlight draping over her silhouette.",
        "13": "The little fox kept waving back to us as he walked. His figure grew smaller and smaller until it became a tiny white spot, which blended into the dandelion sea and slowly faded away.\nAfter he had gone, the mother fox turned and walked over to me.\nThe closer she drew, the greater in stature she became.\nBy the time she stood before me, she had transformed into a human.\nShe was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water — in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops.\n\"What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.\"\nI thought to myself.\nFor all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, still nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the boundless dandelion sea.\nAt last, I could no longer contain myself, and opened my mouth:\n\"Is this the magic you wanted to teach me? The magic of transformation?\"\n\"It is. I am most grateful to you for all your help over this long period.\"\nShe bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams.\nAlthough saying farewell to the little fox left emptiness in my heart, I soon became exhilarated at the thought of the transformation magic that I was about to learn.\nCould I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef.\n\"I could even use magic to hunt!\" I couldn't contain my excitement. \"No more meatless carrot stews for me...\"\n\"Then I shall ask you to stand still.\"\nShe walked circles around me, her stature growing with every pass.\nNo, not just her. The dandelions were also growing in size! They had only been at my ankles when she started, but now stretched to over my waist, growing as if turning into towering trees.\nIt was only when I started to feel strange that I realized that the fox had become a giant.",
        "140": "Nightfall seemed to always hasten its approach over the bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce.\nGazing upward, the silvery moonlight was scattered amidst the shadows of the bamboo forest's leaves. In a spot illuminated under the moonlight, far from the croaking frogs and chirping cicadas, new bamboo culms had just sprouted from the ground.\n\nThe bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce is the verdant home to many fables.\n\nAs night fell, the woman garbed in white began to recount many stories to the young lad, ancient tales that the lad had never heard before.\n\n\"Long ago, three bright moons once hung high the night sky. These three moons were sisters, their years numbering more than those of the Geo Archon and their year of birth predating the very bedrock upon which Liyue Harbor now rests.\nThe moons were daughters of prose and song, sovereign over the night sky. They navigated the heavens above in their silver carriage, alternating with one another thrice a month. If the reign was not promptly passed from one sister to the next, a terrible disaster would occur that very day.\nThese three luminous moons shared but one love, the stars of daybreak. Only at the fleeting moments when day and night converged could one of the three sisters pass the fading stars and gaze upon the chambers of the morning stars. Moments later, as the new dawn would break over the horizon, the carriage would quickly ferry the night's sister away.\nThe three sisters shared an equal affection for their one and only love, much like the affection they shared for one another. But this was all before the world was smashed against the tides of great calamity.\nWith time, disasters overturned the sovereign carriage and laid ruin to the halls of the stars. The three sisters of the night turned against one another, leading to their eternal parting by death. Only one of their pale corpses now remains, ever shedding its cold light...\"\n\nThe woman raised her head and gazed at the moon through the sea of bamboo. Her long, slender neck was covered in the silver light and her eyes shone gold.\n\n\"The wolf packs are children of the moons, they remember the calamities and the tragedies that ensued. Hence, they lament the fate of their mother with each new moon... It is also why those who live among the wolves call the morning stars, the surviving love of the moon, the grievous stars.\"\n\"I see...\"\nThe young lad remained silent for some time.\nThis was a story that the village elders had never told before. Perhaps it was a legend that even the eldest of elders had never heard before. It was a grander tale than those about foxes taking brides and monsters ensnaring people, but a less riveting one than those about the Lord of Geo driving away evil spirits. The woman's tales were almost like a dream of the imagination.\n\n\"These are stories that have never been told, legends that have already been long forgotten by people.\"\nThe woman garbed in white gently stroked the lad's hair and lowered her eyelids. The golden color of her eyes grew a little darker.\n\"Before the ancient immortals established the universe, there were gods that wandered across the lands. It was at this time that many of the adepti came into being. But what about before then?\"\n\"Only broken memories and fragments of the past were turned into stories, and stories turned into legends, passed down among the people...\"\n\"Even deities and adepti would feel sentimental upon hearing such ancient memories that surpass the mortal world.\"\n\nThe woman let out a long sigh and turned to find the young lad fast asleep.\n\"Tsk! Unbelievable...\"\nWith a weary smile, she took off her raincoat and placed it over the young lad.\n\nThat night, the lad dreamt of three moons in the sky, and a silver carriage stopped before the gates of the stars.",
        "141": "As day slowly dawned, the young boy was gently awakened.\n\nDaybreak's light silhouetted the white mist that shrouded the bamboo forest of which tales of ghostly foxes were told. The vapor seemed like a horsetail, as it billowed this way and that.\n\nThe woman held his hand, and together they walked toward the place where the sun pierced through the woods. They turned left, then right, passing through undergrowth teeming with insects, clambering over slippery moss-covered stones, scaling down a gorge hidden by the shadows of the bamboo trees. All the way she led him, till they arrived at the exit of the bamboo forest.\n\n\"I still don't know who you are, or where you're from.\"\nSaid the boy, for the previous night's story had yet to leave his mind.\n\n\"...\"\nThe woman turned, and with her back to the morning light, her eyes shone gold.\nBut she merely smiled, and said nothing.\n\nMany years later, the boy, who was a boy no longer, would remember that moment, and he would understand: the gap between them was as a yawning chasm. His fate was to leave his home and go to Liyue Harbor, to seek the riches the Geo Archon had bestowed upon him. Hers, then, was to hide herself away, away from the majestic, kindly gaze of that great Lord of Geo, and protect those ancient tales that even she was beginning to forget.\n\nSo, the boy and the white-clad, golden-eyed woman were parted.\nHe would pack his things and head for that thriving port city, while she stood silently at the boundaries of the bamboo forest. For in her bewitching eyes, she seemed to have already foreseen the young man's fate — that someday, when he was old, tired of the sea and the waves of life, he would slowly return to this mountain village, and there he would live out the rest of his days.\n\nIn the dawn's glow, the boy heard a whinnying cry that then grew distant.\nHe turned and looked, and there was nothing behind him, but a single strand of hair that had come to rest on his shoulder.",
        "142": "In the land where the dandelion wine flows like a river, tall tales have a way of spreading far and wide, following closely in the wake of the whiff of wine.\nFar-fetched fables are always sure to spread when boasted between burps by inebriated bar patrons. For these stories share something in common with the slurred speech and sea-sickness-inducing swaying that so often accompanies them, which is that despite being clumsy and awkward, they are also highly entertaining.\n\nLegend has it that there was once a famous drunkard in Mondstadt. It was said that he could hold his alcohol as well as any hunter from Springvale in the off season. And yet, still he would drink till he was drunk. Every time that he drank, he would not budge so much as an inch back from the bar at the tavern until not a single Mora was left in his coin pouch, and not a single drop of wine remained in his glass.\n\nOne night, this drunkard was doing his best to stumble home after a particularly satisfying session of especially heavy drinking. A combination of his spinning head, blurred vision, and zigzagging stride served to navigate him towards a forest populated by wolves.\n\nToday, of course, Wolvendom is presided over by the Great Wolf King of the North, and the ominous atmosphere that emanates from inside the forest is sufficient to deter most sober-headed visitors from approaching the area. According to the elderly hunters, the Wolf King gathered the spirits of the wolves there to prevent outsiders from trespassing into territory where they are not welcome.\nBut this was an age long before the Wolf King and the north wind had descended upon that forest, bringing order and peace to the wolven race. At that time, the forest was a perilous place where wild wolves fought for survival. A fierce blood feud between wolves played out deep inside the dense foliage, concealed from view and unbeknownst to any human.\n\nLeast of all to the drunkard, who had by this point managed to transport his drunken self quite some distance inside the forest.\n\nHe stumbled forward in the darkness with that dogged determination that only drunkards possess, deterred neither by the tree roots that would trip him up every few steps, nor by the stray branches that would slyly slap him in the face from time to time.\nBefore long, a pair of green eyes began darting through the forest, their gaze fixed on him, tracking his every move.\nThose eyes belonged to a lone wolf, who silently pursued the drunkard from behind, all the while musing to itself:\n\"This is the most peculiar sight I have ever seen in all my life.\"\n\nNo-one had dared set foot in the wolves' forest in hundreds of years, be they a knight clad top to toe in shining steel armor or a desperate fugitive dressed in rags. Even the callous nobles refused to exile their slaves there, for fear of inciting the wrath of the wild wolves and bringing unwanted trouble to their own territory.\n\n\"And yet, this odd fellow dares to stroll in here all by himself. How very strange indeed!\"\nThe lone wolf pondered this strange phenomenon as it followed the drunken intruder through the forest, doing its best to ignore the stench of alcohol that was wafting its way.",
        "143": "It is a well-known fact that wolves have a far keener sense of smell than humans. Another way of putting this is that their noses are much more sensitive.\nLittle wonder, then, that the stench of alcohol emanating from the wolf's now historically intoxicated prey was quite stifling, and caused tears to well up in its eyes.\n\n\"Awoo...\" the wolf thought to itself.\nHaving been born in the wilderness and grown up in the forest, the wolf had never had any contact with human civilization before this night, and though it had once caught the faint scent of wine wafting across Cider Lake, it did not know the scent's origin, less still understand the significance of that substance to humankind.\n\n\"Perhaps this peculiar fellow is a relative of the skunk, for it seems that he discovered my presence quite some time ago, and now means to poison me in an effort to secure his escape!\"\nThe wolf pondered this possibility as it braced itself against the onslaught of alcoholic fumes, picked up its pace, and discreetly maneuvered its way into the drunkard's shadow — the perfect vantage point from which to inspect its prey.\n\nThe wolf is a creature of caution and calculation. The drunkard, meanwhile, is a different sort of creature entirely.\nAnd yet, though wine tends to dizzy the mind and dull the senses, it sometimes affords its consumers the curious capacity to detect the subtlest of changes in the direction of the wind.\nPerhaps this could explain how a bumbling drunkard, fumbling through the forest, was suddenly able to discover the presence of a wolf that had been stealthily following him the entire time.\nOr perhaps the alcoholic fumes given off by the drunkard were sufficiently potent to diminish the wolf's mental acuity, to the point that the wolf became less mindful of the terrain beneath its paws, the resulting sound of snapping twigs thus alerting the prey to the predator's presence.\n\n\"Who's that? Don't s'pose you know which way the toilet is, by any chance...?\"\nThe bumbling drunkard rubbed his bleary eyes.\n\"Foul-smelling human,\" snarled the wolf, \"Who are you, and whence proceeds your stench?\"\nThe wolf flared its nostrils, bore its fangs, and growled.\n\nNot only was the drunkard unafraid when he heard the wolf's gruffly voiced threat, but he even became quite animated.\n\"My friend!\" the drunkard replied, \"Clearly I've offended you, somehow... sorry 'bout that... but anyway, Mondstadt tradition says you're not allowed to be drunk and bored at the same time... So! Here we are, out in the woods on this glorious moonlit night... How abouts I tell you a story?\"\nHis proposal was promptly punctuated by an almighty belch.\n\nBefore this point, the wolf had had no intention of listening to the belching buffoon's drunken ramblings. In fact, it was poised to deliver a fatal blow to its prey by lunging for the neck, sinking its fangs in, and tearing his throat clean out.\nBut the drunkard's belch blasted a further bout of fumes in the wolf's direction, assailing its nostrils with such force that it ruined the wolf's appetite entirely. Grudgingly, the wolf agreed.\n\"Grr... Perhaps I'm not so hungry after all... Let's see what nonsense tale you have to tell.\"\n\nThe drunkard stretched out his arms and let out a loud yawn, disturbing a few dandelions in the process.\nAnd with that, the drunkard began to tell his tale.",
        "144": "Legend tells of a lone wolf that roamed a barren wasteland far, far away.\n\nOnce, he had been king of his pack, leading them in the hunt, in battle, and in the search for a home... Now, the sole remaining legacy of those days were the scars that covered his body.\n\nHe had led the way as they ran across open plains, navigated through abandoned ruins, and passed through the domains of monsters and the Seelie.\nThe wasteland was a cruel place. The wolf-king grew older with each passing day, and the other wolves gradually dispersed. As time went by, the wolf pack's history faded into distant memory, until finally only the aged wolf-king remained, the sole survivor of its pack.\n\nThis wasteland is said to be a land beyond the dominion of deities, inhabited only by the grotesque ghostly remains of fallen gods, where the former palaces of the Seelie now stand empty. So when the solitary old wolf passed by a gray palace and heard the sound of music coming from within, it caught its attention.\n\n\"Never before have I heard a sound so pleasing to the ears, whether it be a song of bird or insect, that it stays the pangs of hunger in my starved stomach as this tune does.\"\nIntrigued, the wolf stepped inside the gray hall, trod across the overgrown weeds, and passed by a broken sarcophagus, on which a portrait of the deceased ruler was still clearly visible.\n\nFinally, he came to an inner room, where he saw a fair maiden strumming at her instrument.\nHer skin was ashen white and her head was bowed down, her slender fingers gently stroking the fragile strings of the lute as she played a long-forgotten and mournful melody.\n\nThe wolf sat down in front of the pale young maiden and forgot all about the pain of hunger, thirst, and loneliness for a short while, as it listened in silence to her song.\n\n\"The chirping of insects on a long-gone autumn night is the chorus of exiles, singing mankind's most ancient song as they live out their plight...\"\n\"Stripped of all that the body once held close and the soul once held dear, songs and memories are all that now remain of yesteryear.\"\n\"The last singers, the first Seelie, they played their final tune in the hall of angels.\"\n\nThe tiny Seelie playing in the forest were also drawn to the young maiden's tune, and flocked to her to pay their respects.\n\n\"What is this song that you play?\"\nThe wolf asked, puzzled, for it understood every line, every word, every syllable she spoke — and yet, hers was a language that it had never heard before, quite unlike that of any other living being.\n\n\"A song of the Seelie,\"\nReplied the pale young maiden in a soft voice.\n\"Long, long ago, we wrote this song for the human savages. Yet now, we sing it to mourn our own fate.\"\n\nThe wolf began to sing along, albeit clumsily, to the maiden's tune.\nThe wolf's voice was husky and broken, filled with a lifetime of sorrow.\n\n\"What are you singing?\"\nThe maiden asked of the wolf.\n\n\"This is our song,\"\nResponded the wolf.\n\n\"It sounds ghastly.\"\nThe maiden made no attempt to soften her criticism as she continued to caress the lute strings.\n\"But, you are welcome to sing along with me all the same.\"\n\nAnd so, a shared chorus sung by fair young maiden and weary old wolf filled the chambers of the long-abandoned palace. It is said that to this day, adventurers who pass by this place still hear a strange yet harmonious melody sounding from within.\n\n\"And then? ...The story ends here?\"\nThe wolf licked its lips, somewhat ruefully, and then said:\n\"I suppose I shall tell you a story now.\"\n\nAnd with that, the wolf cleared its throat and began to tell its tale.",
        "145": "Legend has it that the first wine of Mondstadt was brewed in the age when the north wind howled.\n\nIn the age when the Kings of Ice and Frost fought for dominion, Mondstadt's forbears brewed rudimentary wine from wild fruits, even as they shivered in the biting cold. They did so to ease the pain of their frostbitten fingers and to give them the courage to face the harsh and unforgiving ice. For at that time, the land of Mondstadt was engulfed by ice and snow, and the dandelions had not yet reared their heads.\n\nIt is said that the first person in Mondstadt to discover the craft of wine brewing was a grossly negligent guard.\n\nIn a tribe beset by blizzards on all sides, it was the unenviable job of the hardy hunter-gatherers to stock the storage pits with food, and it was the guard's task to guard against intruders.\nThe sight of a human intruder was a rare one indeed in that harsh environment — but there were other creatures who could better withstand the cold, and they would burrow underground to reach the food stocks. The rules of the tribe were that one person should inspect the storage pits at all times, filling in any mouse holes discovered — or better still, catching them red-handed in the act of pilfering — to keep the tribe's food supplies at plentiful levels.\n\nAt that time, the damp, dark caves needed constant care and attention to prevent the food they held from going bad and rotting. On top of this, the mischievous little creatures that hid away out of sight would sometimes play pranks on the guards.\n\nOne day, a wily wind spirit noticed that the grossly negligent guard was once again being grossly negligent. So, the spirit took the form of a fox and crept into a pile of wild apples. There, it caused yeast to grow, ripening the apples and causing them to ferment.\nThe grossly negligent guard was ravenous when he returned, and elected to partake of one of the apples. The mellow taste of fermented fruit delighted both his body and his mind. Immediately, he took animal hide and squeezed the juice from the apples, creating wine.\n\nThe grossly negligent guard who first invented brewing in the age of ice and snow also became Mondstadt's first drunkard. It is said that he was the first person ever to fall into a drunken dream.\n\nIn his first drunken dream, he drunkenly entered the dreams of a lone wolf. Somewhere in the long-lost past or possibly the far-flung future, he fought fang and claw with rival wolf packs, battled with humans for food in the midst of a raging snowstorm, and met the first Seelie.\n\nThe tribe-dwelling human and the pack-dwelling wolf could not bear to live in solitude. This newly brewed wine served to bring man and wolf together in their dreams.\n\nBut their attitudes towards these dreams were poles apart.\n\nThe human who knew only the wind and snow yearned for the wasteland where the lone wolf runs freely, but the lone wolf was fearful of the human's desire. It could not understand why this human was captivated by dangerous illusions and sought hope from within them.\nWhat concerned the wolf even more was that when in a drunken human dream, it could no longer distinguish whether it was a wolf or a human with a wolven spirit.\n\nSo the wolf swore an oath never to touch the humans' poison again, to resist the allure of wine.\nWolves are not the children of the wind, and the land of wine and song is not their home. So the wolves left the humans' domain and settled far off in the wilderness and deep in the mountain forests, places where the scent of wine could not reach them.\n\n\"What you humans call wine, we wolves call the abyss,\"\nThe wolf haughtily concluded.\nBut as the wolf turned towards the drunkard to say this line, it discovered that the drunkard was now lying fast asleep on a bed of pine branches.\n\nThe wolf was most displeased, and violently expelled a puff of air from its nostrils before leaving the still-pungent pile of sleeping human to his business, and going on its way.",

        "147": "Liyue is a land where all kinds of rare and exotic treasures congregate, and where there are precious treasures, one is sure to also find those with a discerning eye.\n\nThe very first owner of Xigu Antiques — the unconventional collector, Min'gui — was just such an individual.\n\nXigu Antiques of Feiyun Slope was frequented by well-to-do customers. Closed during daylight hours, it only opened to customers once the moon began to rise in the night sky. The shop's customers were anything but ordinary: they were the wealthy and leisurely, people with outstanding taste.\n\nA meticulously crafted timepiece from Fontaine, incense from Sumeru, a wine goblet once owned by an aristocrat of old Mondstadt, a wooden stool whose surface was once graced by the buttocks of an adeptus for all of one hour, a delicate jade teacup from which the Lord of Geo once supped a sip of tea, a priceless celadon vase that Liyue's neighbor deity, the Anemo Archon, once accidentally knocked to the ground, shattering it to pieces... All these and more were laid out for the customers to peruse at their leisure, each item just waiting for that one person with whom it shared a certain affinity.\n\nOne night, a wealthy young man who was walking by happened to pause in front of the shop, and began carefully examining the items on the shelves.\n\nThe owner was struck by his long, black robes, dark and solemn as the looming mountain peaks, and by his eyes, which were the color of amber.\n\nThis was no ordinary young man. This Min'gui could tell with one look.\n\n\"Welcome to Xigu Antiques,\" she said. \"Please peruse at your leisure, and let me know if you find something you like.\"\nHer soft voice broke the dead silence of the night.\n\"Ah...? Oh, I'm sorry.\"\nThe young man smirked, and spoke in a subtly coy manner.\n\n\"I'm just rather taken with this exquisite counterfeit.\"\n\nThe item that had caught his eye was a damaged jade plaque.\n\nThe face exposed to the night sky was the one on which the pattern was slightly more intact, and as the moonlight shone down, it seeped into the intricate blemishes in the jade, revealing them, and cascaded down into the ravines produced by the crisscrossing texture on the plaque's surface. The severe wear and tear on the front and the disintegration around the perimeter made it impossible to discern the words and images that had once been written on it. By all accounts, it seemed to have lived a turbulent life.\n\n\"Counterfeit, you say? What makes you so sure?\"\nMin'gui was quite used to customers making such provocative claims. But this young man spoke so bluntly and bitingly that she could not help but feel aggravated by his accusation.\n\nAdded to this was the fact that this particular item had been snagged by an adventurer from an abandoned palace deep in the heart of the abyss, who had then barely made it back out of that place alive. She recalled how she had haggled relentlessly with the adventurer to acquire the piece, and how in the end it had still cost her the better part of her fortune. If this truly was nothing more than a counterfeit, not only would it imply that she had lost an immense portion of her wealth, but it would also mean irrevocable damage to the reputation of Xigu Antiques as connoisseurs of quality.\n\nMin'gui knew what she had to do: Not only must she somehow get rid of this calamitous customer who threatened to ruin her entire business, but she must also find a way to sell this jade plaque to him in the process.\n\n\"Please, continue,\" she said. \"I would hope that you can give a detailed appraisal.\"\n\n————————\n\n\"As we all know, Teyvat was plunged into chaos two and a half millennia ago when the gods declared war on each other, the ensuing conflict spreading to all people in all corners of the land. Teyvat may not have been divided into the same seven nations we know today back in that age, but then, just as now, the people had their own settlements, cities and civilizations...\"\n\"Gods whose names have now long since been forgotten were once venerated, worshiped, even adored by their people. Our forebears took pearls and shells from the sea, jade from the mountains, rocks from the plains, and salt crystals from the earth, each to build idols in the form of their gods.\"\n\"Jade plaques of this kind are relics of that era. They belonged to an ancient tribe who worshiped Rex Lapis... though, of course, the Geo Lord probably did not yet go by the name Rex Lapis at that time.\"\n\"This was an age when the people watched their gods clash in bitter battles before their very eyes. Rex Lapis would not establish the currency of the seven nations and cast the first Mora coins for quite some time. So the tribes traded using pieces of ore they would chance across from time to time, with idols made in the likeness of the Geo Lord to ensure price stability.\"\n\"As you can see... mortal wisdom is quite a fascinating thing. They were making their own way in the world even before Rex Lapis had made provisions for them to do so.\"\n\nThe young man paused as if to further contemplate the observation he had just made.\nHe stood there, cloaked in a veil of silver moonlight, which somehow served to make him ever so slightly more diminutive in stature.\n\n\"This type of jade plaque is a rare find in this day and age. Most of them are buried in riverbeds up in the mountains. And since each one is hand carved, they are all unique... That is why they typically sell for astronomical prices. To claim that they are priceless would not be an exaggeration.\"\n\"So, it is quite a shame indeed that the one you display on your shelf is a recent counterfeit. By recent, I mean that it was probably made in your father's generation at the earliest.\"\n\"There is an industry saying: 'The jade without blemish is no jade at all.' This jade, for instance, has remarkably few imperfections, and the translucency is too good to be true... All of which points to the fact that it is unlikely to be a product of our forebears' making.\"\n\"As a side point, I would also add that the image carved onto this jade is that of a woman. This is a highly unusual thing to see among similar relics from the era in question.\"\n\nThe young man held the plaque up to the moonlight to inspect it in more detail.\n\"Although there are plenty of rumors to this effect, the claim that Rex Lapis once took the form of a woman is not attested to by any of the historical records, and there is no physical evidence of it ever occurring...\"\n\nThough young, the man had the air of an old and infuriating pedant about him.\n\n\"Ah, well this is where you're wrong...\"\nMin'gui smiled faintly, much as a fox does when toying with an inexperienced hunter.\n\"Perhaps you'd be willing to listen to my story before making your final verdict?\"\n\nThe shop owner narrowed her eyes and began the process of reeling out her story...",
        "148": "Back in the age when the gods still walked upon the earth, the deity whom we now worship as Rex Lapis was but one among many.\nIn those days, the rumor among the common folk was that the Lord of Geo was a cold and unfeeling god. His conduct was just in all things, and his judgments were rational and dispassionate, but he lacked normal human sentiment. Like the rocks, he was without warmth or softness.\nDespite this, people revered and placed their faith in him all the same. This was because his laws served to guarantee that trade was fair and that life was safe and orderly. The Geo Archon grew in strength and stature because of the people's belief in him.\n\nBut even gods are powerless to control the beliefs and doubts of their mortal followers.\nAnd even a god who is the guardian of justice has no means of instilling the words of his rules and regulations into the heart of every individual.\n\nIn Mingyun Village, there was an incorrigibly irreverent jade craftsman who loved to jest. Whatever job he took on, he would complete it in the most unorthodox means imaginable, and would always finish the job on the very last day before it was due.\n\nIf a customer ordered a statue of a hunter dominating a ferocious beast, they would receive a miniature statue of a distressed boar running for its life.\nAnd when the customer demanded an explanation, he would tell them:\n\"When a formidable hunter closes in on a fierce beast, he may not show his face, but his imposing presence is enough to frighten the beast to its core.\"\n\nIf a customer ordered a carving in the likeness of a powerful and mighty ruler, they would probably receive a statue of a majestic throne.\nAnd when asked about it, he would reply:\n\"No ruler takes the throne for more than one hundred years. The throne has more longevity than he.\"\n\nThe craftsman quickly developed a reputation as an eccentric in Mingyun Village. But the wealthy merchants in the prosperous commercial port of Liyue Harbor were most amused and were only too willing to place orders with him — if only to experience for themselves what it was like to be on the receiving end of this mischievous man's antics.\n\n——————\n\nOne night, a woman came to his workshop.\nShe was dressed in a long, slender black gown and her eyes shone a brilliant amber in the light of the crescent moon hanging in Liyue's sky that night.\nThe craftsman had never met her before, but he quickly found himself deep in conversation with her. Strangely, she seemed acquainted with every vein of ore and deposit of jade in the village. She talked about the wonders of the world like they were her sisters, and spoke of jade and precious metals with a fondness one would normally reserve for their beloved daughter...\nThe only topics she brushed over were culture, customs, and social interactions.\nPerhaps she was not wise to the ways of the world, or perhaps she did not wish to discuss them. Regardless, there was certainly something out of the ordinary about this woman.\nAt least, the craftsman thought so.\n\n\"I would like for you to make me a jade plaque bearing the likeness of the Lord of Geo on its surface.\"\nThe woman finally stated her request once their broad-reaching and lengthy conversation had reached its end, and she was all but ready to leave.\n\"But I have one condition: You may not conjure up our Lord's likeness from your imagination. You must carve the true likeness of our Lord relying on what you have seen with your own two eyes.\"\n\"Otherwise,\" she said, \"I'm not paying a single Mora.\"\n\nAnd so a deal was struck between the two, with an agreed turnaround of three days.\n\nOn the first day, the craftsman dined and drank with his good friends. He did not take a single new job on that day.\n\nOn the second day, the craftsman climbed a mountain to view the jade there, not seeing a single customer or acquaintance for the entire day.\n\nOnly on the third day did the craftsman close the doors of his workshop and begin carving away at the uncut jade, working from dawn till dusk, until finally it was complete.\n\nWhen the crescent moon once again began to rise in the Liyue night sky, the amber-eyed woman returned and approached his doorstep.\nThe craftsman proudly handed over the fruits of his labor:\nA jade plaque bearing the likeness of their god, in female form.\n\nThe woman was puzzled. She frowned, and demanded an explanation.\nAnd this was the explanation that he gave:\n\"On the first day, I sought counsel from every wise and learned person that I know, and learned the principles of our Lord and how they work. But this was just the skeleton.\"\n\"On the second day, I visited the mountains and spent a whole day observing the mountain rocks, listening to the ebb and flow of the elements, and pondering all that our Lord had created. But this was just the flesh.\"\n\"On the third day, I covered both my eyes and began to carve from the heart, starting when it felt like the time to start, stopping when it felt like the time to stop. At last, this was the spirit.\"\n\nThe craftsman smiled awkwardly, then added:\n\"But even I'm not sure why it came out like this.\"\n\nThe woman tilted the item back and forth in her hand, as if contemplating something.\n\"Interesting,\" she finally responded. \"Incidentally, this reminds me of another story...\"\n\nShe looked up at him with her amber-colored eyes and began the process of reeling out her story...",

At the height of Liyue Harbor's prosperity, a myriad goods and treasures flowed endlessly in and out of the land like the rising and falling tides.\nThat age belonged, as does the current one, to the wealthy merchants and ship owners. It was an age in which the ones who reigned supreme were those who dared wrestle with the tumultuous tides of the market and the wrathful beasts of the ocean.\n\nLikewise, then as now, the port was constantly abuzz with sailors and laborers.\nLegend has it that Rex Lapis, when appearing in mortal form, does not always take the form of a distinguished gentleman fraternizing with the well-to-do of Yujing Terrace. Sometimes, it is said, he takes the form of a commoner and mingles with the miners, the fishermen, the sailors, and the peddlers.\n\nBack in that day, there was a certain fishing vessel owner who was notoriously harsh and critical in his temperament. He was always rude towards those who worked for him, and whenever something wasn't to his satisfaction, he would jump to conclusions and start scolding them, even docking their wages, without giving them the opportunity to explain their side of the story.\n\nOne day, the fishing vessel owner met a young man.\nHe had just been hired by the fishing vessel owner, and his attire was indistinguishable from that of any other seafarer of the day: a loose-fitting brown shirt and trousers, and a bandana around his forehead. But from his tanned skin and the rugged, karst-like contours of his facial features, it was clear that he was a commoner from Qingce Village who had come down from the mountains into the city in an attempt to reverse his fortunes.\n\nLike most mountain-dwellers of his day, he was a simple-minded and unsophisticated fellow. But what dismayed his new boss more than this was his reluctance to go anywhere near the catches of the slimy and tentacled variety.\n\n\"You don't make money by being choosy! Who do you think you are, lord of the manor?\"\nThis was the only justification the ship owner gave for docking the newly hired mountain man's pay.\n\nThe youngster simply smiled bashfully and continued with his work. This set the tone for many of the interactions between the two.\nBut one day, the youngster responded instead with a question:\n\"Everyone has likes and dislikes, so why should we do the things we hate the most?\"\n\nThe fishing vessel owner was taken completely by surprise by this random question. Incensed, he slapped his simpleton apprentice on the head and barked back at him:\n\"Them's the rules of the world, you moron! Listen good: You'll get yourself nowhere in this world if you won't do a job you don't like!\"\n\n\"But maybe that wasn't what Rex Lapis meant when he made the rules...\"\n\n\"Shut up, you idiot!\"\n\n\"Hmm, maybe you'll understand better if I tell you a story.\"\nThe young man's eyes shone like amber from the mountain mines in the light of the setting sun.\n\n\"Oh? So you're a storyteller now, are you?\"\nAt the thought of this simpleton from a sleepy mountain village telling him a story, the fishing vessel owner found himself suddenly quite curious.\n\"Go on then... But I expect you to work and talk at the same time!\"\n\nA mischievous smile flickered across the youngster's face, and a twinkle flashed in his eye.\n\"Well then, let me tell you a story about a certain jade plaque...\"\n\nAnd so, the young man proceeded to tell his tale.

No one knew his name or his past, and no one dared ask.\n\nThey only knew that his shoulders bore a great blood debt, from a past as crimson as his eyes.\n\nFor red they were, and sharp, like a blade, piercing the hearts of all he gazed upon as he pleased.\nHis character was much the same, like a sharp knife that might pierce another person's heart at any time without forewarning.\n\n\"It's time.\"\nThe chief shook his head as he talked to himself, the cold moonlight dancing over his shaven crown.\n\nOutside, a ravenous demon wielded a blood-letting long sword, massacring his followers one after the other.\nThough Tupi Village was full of evil people, schools and sects had their rules, and so none would dare come knocking with rash provocations and talk of revenge.\nBut Jin the Seventy-Second had no school or sect, and was thus unbound by any such rules. He was but a single starving ghost with a lone sharp blade, yearning to taste the blood of his enemies.\n\nThe wind and rain accompanied the din of battle, and the downpour washed away the crimson that stained the swordsman, only for another layer to be painted on immediately...\n\nThe crimson swordsman strode forward amid a crimson mist. Many were his wounds, but none could stay his hand.\n\nWhen that mist had at last cleared in the endless deluge, the swordsman crossed the turbid red beneath his feet, and stalked towards the chief's mansion.\n\n—\n\nThe din beyond the gates quieted, and only now did the chief raise a cup of wine, and scatter the alcohol into the air with a flick.\nPerhaps to toast the fated meeting to come, or as a ritual for his sullied soul.\n\nThe doors opened. It was Jin the Seventy-Second, his reddened outline juxtaposed against the blinding gray elements outside.\n\n\"I have questions for you, village chief.\"\n\n\"You've taken quite a few of my men's lives.\"\n\n\"Exactly three hundred and sixty-two. No more, no less...\"\n\nThe chief spoke naught, and his face remained still, but the pulsing vein in his temple betrayed the fire within.\n\n\"...Ah yes, and one dog.\"\n\nSo saying, the crimson silhouette tossed a certain object forward. It clattered atop the wine case...\n...And it was the bone of the dog that guarded the door. It had been stewed for a time and was picked clean almost to the marrow.\n\nFor in this half an hour, not only had Jin the Seventy-Second snuffed out the lives of three hundred and sixty-two able men, but he had even turned the dog keeping the gate into dog meat stew.\n\nWhat cruelty.\nWhat ruthlessness!\n\nThe village chief let out a terrible scream, and standing, he drew his sword—",
        "153": "The rain had ceased, but light had yet to recoup the skies.\n\nJin the Seventy-Second had obtained news of his nemesis from the mouth of the village chief.\nNow, not a thing was left in Tupi Village but masterless rooms and masterless spirits.\n\nAnd not even that remained, for this was a world without spirits.\nThis world possessed no elemental power.\nAnd so, the memories of the dead could not remain in the mortal realm via elemental resonance.\n\nThe village chief was a formidable foe. His blade was swift as could be, and he had left many wounds on Jin the Seventy-Second, each deep enough to cut bone.\nBut alas, his \"heart\" was far too slow.\n\nFor this was a world without elements.\nAnd thus swordsmanship could not be imbued with them.\nSwordsmanship was thus a question of pure physical skill and not elemental control.\nThe sword is an extension of one's body, and one uses it as an arm would command the fingers, or as one's heart directs the eyes.\nThough he was skilled indeed in the art of the swift blade, the village chief never understood the value of the \"heart,\" and so he fell to a single stroke.\n\nJin the Seventy-Second strode towards the fallen chief, discarding the broken incense burner in his left hand.\n\nFor the chief had focused too narrowly on pouring savage strokes upon the swordsman's body, thinking him too harried to fight back, and had no eyes for his enemy's left hand, which should have been empty—\n\n—And in a flash, the incense burner had struck the chief of Tupi Village on the forehead, sending him tumbling into a wall where he then collapsed, immobile.\n\n\"Underhanded villain...\"\n\nBut only the wind answered him — the villain gripping the bloodied censer said not a word.\n\n\"...The person you're looking for is in the barren mountains beyond this village... Go seek your death there...\"\n\nBut the villain had departed, and all that remained to answer him was the rustling of the wind...\n\nAnd the crackling of wild flames.",
        "154": "Jin the Seventy-Second waited till the rainbow had dispersed before setting off once from Tupi Village toward the barren mountains.\nAncient legend held that these barren mountains had been brought into being by slices from the Celestial Emperor's blade, and thus were incredibly hard to scale.\nFolk tales also held that they were called barren, for they had soaked up the tears of the Earth Mother, and thus had become bitterly salty lands where nothing grew.\n\nThe barren mountains had once been mined for gold and gems, but the mines had all been ruined in an earthquake, their workers buried within.\nNo one tried ever again to create the facilities to mine the mountain's bounty, and its caverns were infested with wicked beasts and bandits.\n\nAnd among these evils hidden in the mountains was Jin the Seventy-Second's nemesis.\nThe swordsman's shoulders shivered, and his gait hesitant, for the wounds he had been given in the battle against the chief of Tupi Village hindered him still.\n\nHe knew that many pairs of eyes stared out at him from between the wither rocks, and the breath of beasts who had caught the scent of his blood was all around.\nLong years of bloodshed had honed Jin the Seventy-Second's senses to their limit.\n\nHe sensed that the lifeless mountains were in fact a giant death trap.\nBandits and villains lay in wait for him to enter some narrow grotto, or squeeze into a tiny gorge, or pass by a collapsed mine shaft. Then, they would set upon him in the darkness with knives, and finish him.\n\nBut from the looks of things now, the steep mountains now looked like they might be enough to kill Jin the Seventy-Second.\nThe swordsman limped with every step he took, and the road was small and treacherous. Every so often, gravel would slip loose beneath his feet.\n\nAt the same time, upon a cliff twisted about with sinuous, dead trees, two figures squinted as they observed the tiny wanderer.\n\n\"He has been worse for wear since he departed from the mountain's base. If we but leave him to the treacherous trek, he will surely fall into the abyss below.\"\nSo said a bone-thin old crone.\n\nShe glanced to her side, icy death in her jade-blue eyes, sharp as a viper hidden in a rocky cleft.\n\n\"Not so!\"\nShe turned to face the booming voice of a corpulent old man.\n\"He slew three hundred and sixty-two at Tupi Village, and even cooked the dog at the gate for stew.\"\n\"Though he may have been badly wounded by the village chief to the point where he can barely move, we should still beware of him.\"\n\n\"Hmph...\"\nThe old woman vanished into the withered forest with a displeased noise.\n\n\"...\"\nThe old man watched a while longer as the lame swordsman stopped for a moment more, before patting his large belly and slowly departing.\nNot a single withered tree or blade of dying grass was touched as he did.\n\nThen suddenly the sky turned dark with gathering stormclouds, and mordant rain again began to fall lightly.\nIn the mountain rain, the wounded Jin the Seventy-Second leaned on his sword like a crutch, and struggled forward.\nBut the chilling cold and the loss of blood was too much for him to bear, and he fell upon the gravel and barren stone.\n\nJust as the darkness took him, he caught a glimpse of the billowing hem of azure-blue skirts...\nHe could've sworn he'd seen that sight before.",

        "156": "For the next few days after that night, the fox never came again.\nBut in those few days, prey in the forest became gradually more abundant.\nEverything from small finches, long-legged cranes, and even scurrying boars...\nMaybe it was the change in season, or some sort of repayment from the fox. Whatever the case, the following days brought real stew to the table.\nBut the fox never came again.\nAs strange as it may seem, it had honestly been easier to sleep hungry. Even with a full, satisfied stomach, I couldn't help but think about the day we met, and the woman that the fox had turned into...\nWhen would I gaze upon her eyes again, glittering... like water in a lake.\nLying half-asleep with a heart full of turmoil, I heard a faint sound outside my door.\nI hopped from the bed and swung the door open, eager to see a small white silhouette awaiting me.\nBut there were no lake-blue eyes, and there was no fluffy white foxtail. Instead, all I could see were dandelion seeds drifting in the white moonlight, floating like snowflakes in the air.\nSuddenly, something got caught in my nostrils.\n\"Ah-Ahchooo!!!\"\nImmediately, the fluffy white dandelion seeds began to swirl, filling the sky like a snowstorm.\nAmidst the flurry of dandelion seeds, a pair of jewel-like eyes were looking at me, staring straight into my heart.\nWaving away the swirling dandelion seeds, I started walking towards the small fox.\nThe fox raised its ears and its furry tail flitted across the grass as it turned and disappeared into the depths of the forest.\nI hurried and followed closely behind.\nIn amongst the darkness of the trees, soft patches of white could be seen weaving between the shadows.\nTheir silhouettes tip-toed like moonlight cast among the tree leaves, or like the hesitant strides of a crafty Seelie.\nWith unfaltering trust, I followed the fox round and about, soon emerging from the dark forest in a seemingly faraway land.\nThere, in the moonlight, a sea of dandelions lay before me, stretching as far as my eyes could see.\nStunned by the sight, I began to notice a rustling noise coming from just behind me.\nIt was a light, delicate sound. Like that of a girl walking barefoot across pine needles and leaves on the ground.\nThe fox approached me from behind. The night air ferried her presence, cool and damp, whisked together with the slightly bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers.\nTwo hands with slender, ice-cold fingers rested upon my shoulders.\nShe leaned in close to my ear and her long hair draped down over my shoulder.\nBehind me, I felt the soft rhythm of both her breath and her heartbeat. It made me feel calm and at ease.\n\"Only the foxes know the way to this place. It is the homeland of the dandelions.\nIt is my desire that you would tarry here, and teach my child human language...\nIn return, I will teach you the magic of foxes.\"\nThere was a tickle in my ear, as if one of the dandelion seeds had grazed it on its journey into the warm night air.\nStrange. I had certainly never mentioned anything about magic to her before. How could she have known?\nWithout answering, she took my hand and led me into the depths of the sea of dandelions.\nThe night breezes from both north and south carried the bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers and faded memories...\nIn those fields of velvet white, she showed me how foxes play gently together in their own fashion, until the moon rose high into the starry sky.",
        "157": "\"When he has mastered human language...\"\nThus she softly said.\nI looked at her face, mesmerized.\nI couldn't hear what she said after that. The mischievous night breeze was laden with dandelion seeds, which muffled her words.\nOr perhaps that was her native language? The language of dandelions?\nShe began to laugh as she perceived my clumsy, gauche appearance.\nShe had the most beautiful laugh. The curved pupils in her eyes glistened like two crescent moons shining on ripples in the lake.\n\"Now, tell me then, why is it you wish to learn fox magic?\"\n\"I want to learn to transform just like foxes do. That way I could turn into a bird and fly to the highest of heights, and behold places that were once too far for my eyes to see.\"\nThat was my reply.\n\"Ahh yes, no longer will I need to lie in wait among the bushes while hunting. Instead, I will be able to freely soar high above like a falcon.\"\nThus I kept thinking to myself.\nAs I was thought to myself, the dandelion seed in my hand began to float up towards the moonlight, almost as if it had heard my thoughts.\n\"I see...\"\nShe lowered her head slightly and her long, black hair flowed down her neck like a waterfall, glistening in the moonlight. Her pale white skin shone brightly, seemingly reflecting the wisps of clouds in the night sky above.\nI couldn't take my eyes off her. After a moment, I quickly turned my gaze away as I started blushing again.\nFoxes are free animals. They would never cover their beauty because of shame like humans do.\nAlthough this certainly wasn't the first time I beheld her, every time the moonlight shone upon her long hair, I couldn't help but blush and look away.\nShe turned her face in thought for a moment, and let out a gentle sigh. She seemed rather displeased.\nWe sat amidst the dandelion sea, not saying a word. A long time passed, long enough that I started thinking that she might be angry with me.\n\"We foxes are grateful beings. I will teach you the magic of transformation, and so fulfill your wish.\"\nThe fox said, turning her face towards me.\nHer lake-blue eyes shone in the moonlight, and it made me feel at peace.\nThank goodness, she wasn't mad at me.\nFor some reason I could not clearly name, I quietly heaved a sight of relief.",
        "158": "Foxes are clever animals. Clever and cunning.\nThe little fox learned very quickly, and could sometimes even ask questions that would stump me.\nFor human speech is complicated and intricate, nothing like the innocence of animal speech.\nSometimes, language is like a yarn ball caught in the paws of a cat. It catches here and there, and there again it catches a student's tongue, sometimes even tripping a teacher up.\nBut foxes are clever animals, and very quickly they learn the many intricacies of human speech that were handed down over the generations, becoming able to describe the way dandelions float away, or how the moonlight shines over the lake in a rudimentary manner.\nEvery time the little fox discovered a new term, every time he tried using unfamiliar words to explore a familiar world, to bestow meanings upon the wind, dandelions and the earth, she would be beside him, smiling, watching us.\nThe little fox learned very quickly, but I did not take much joy from that.\nWhen I had run out of things to teach, would she still keep me here in this dandelion sea?\nWhen that time came, would I still be able to behold those beautiful eyes under the moonlight?\nWould she still lead me into the depths of the dandelion sea, smiling slyly as we frolicked and breathed in the bitter fragrance that came from both the north and south winds?\nAs I thought about such things, I became lost in sullen memory.\nYes, that's right. On that night that I could no longer remember clearly, when I was about to part with the girl I loved, this same moon had hung in the sky as well.\n\"Thank you for everything up till now.\"\nBefore I knew it, the fox had walked in front of me. She bowed, and her hair spilled over her shoulders, flowing like water in the glimmering moonlight.\n\"Once he has learned human speech, he should be able to make more new friends.\"\n\"I am truly thankful to you for all you've done. He has also cheered up significantly since beginning to learn the human language.\"\nShe gazed at me, her deep, unfathomable eyes shining like jewels.\n\"Still, once you have finished teaching us the human language, where will you go then?\"\nEnraptured by those shining eyes, I forgot to reply.\nWas this fox magic, too?\nSeeing my wooden expression, the fox laughed and sighed.\nThen, she turned and began walking in the direction of the moon, leading me further into the center of the moonlit dandelion sea.\nSeeing this, the little fox swished its tail from side to side, and burrowed into the dandelion fields.",

Neither the biggest, bravest animals nor even the weasel, who is the most skilled digger of them all, could find so much as a single blade of soft grass or a single piece of juicy fruit.\nThe Princess was shivering from head to tail in the freezing cold, yet she was undaunted. Without even looking back, she pressed on deeper into the frozen wasteland.\nThe wise fox and the trustworthy turtle could not bear the piercing wind and the freezing snow. They begged of the Princess:\n\"Ack-ack-ack! If His Majesty the King knew that you were adventuring to such a cold and dangerous place as this, he would be very worried! Let's head back home... Ack-ack-ack,\" exclaimed the fox.\n\"Yes, I agree! I fear the snowstorm will get stronger and colder with each passing second... Let us at least rest a while, and continue our journey once the wind has stopped and the sun is out? Once again, I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds,\" reasoned the turtle.\nIt was to no avail. The persevering Princess did not heed the advice of her wise companions, but insisted that they continue to press on into the bitter cold of the far north.\nFor what nobler cause could one pursue in this world than rescuing lost kin and rekindling lost friendships?\nOnwards they continued through the ice and snow, until their paws and hooves were purple from the cold, until each breath they exhaled turned into ice which became one with the swirling blizzard around them.\nThen, at the icy peak of a tall mountain, next to a frozen river which, in spite of everything, still flowed — albeit with icicles rather than water — the Princess met a spirit, swaying to and fro in the freezing wind.\nAn ancient race of wise spirits lived atop that ice-capped mountain. They had no physical form, but possessed great magical power.\n\"Oink oink! Are you the master of this place? Please, O Spirit, could you guide us through this snowstorm?\"\nThe Princess politely posed her question as her hooves, now numb from the cold, trembled in the snow.\nThe wise fox and the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle also looked expectantly at the spirit of the snowstorm. As they gazed, their paws and flippers, respectively, numb from the cold, trembled in the snow.\n\"Whoosh, whoosh...\"\nThe spirit of the snowstorm spoke softly.\n\"Of course, but... whoosh, whoosh...\"\n\"In return, I will sap your energy. The further forward you go in the storm, the more tired and hungry you will become — though I assure you, it will not be life threatening... I hope... Whoosh, whoosh...\"\n\"Oink oink! This is, after all, the spirit of the snowstorm,\" pondered the Princess.\n\"And I am also in the company of the two wisest, most caring members of my family. Whatever may happen, they will always be able to find a way!\"\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Princess granted the spirit of the snowstorm her request. The wise fox and the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle had no time at all to formulate, let alone articulate, any remonstration.\n\"Oink oink, I do declare this deal a fair one! Now, lead us to the wolf pup!\"\nAnd so, the spirit turned into an ice stream, and carried the persevering Princess over the tall mountain...",

During the writing of this book, Musk traveled across the continent to visit every hilichurl tribe, even going so far as to venture deep into hilichurl settlements and become intimately acquainted with their lives. Musk was praised as the \"Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian\" for this book, but it is evident that neither the scholar himself nor the hilichurls were particularly fond of this honor. Jacob Musk, though enthusiastic about hilichurl studies, loathed to be associated with them even in his late years.\n\nThe first song:\nMi muhe ye\nMi biat ye\nBiat ye dada\nMuhe dada\n\nQuite possibly a battle song sung by the hilichurls before combat. I have observed that when two or more hilichurls are present, they engage in frenzied brawling after singing this vulgar song.\n\nThe second poem:\nEleka mimi-a-Domu\nMita domu-a-dada\nLa-la-la\nLa-la-la\nMimi mosi ye mita\n\nThe song is sung by hilichurls as they dance around totem poles. In my estimation it is some form of tribal hymn. It has an upbeat tone and is usually heard during festivals.\n\nThe third poem:\nMi muhe mita nye\nMi muhe mita nye\nMuhe nye\nMuhe nye\nGusha\nBiat, gusha\n\nA melancholic hilichurl song I heard during an exchange with an elderly samachurl. Although I do not yet understand the literal meaning of the poem, the overwhelming sense of grief that comes through in the song is enough to captivate the best poets in my birthplace (despite such praise, I must admit the acrid smells coming from the elderly hilichurls were just as melancholic, and just as overwhelming).",

After all, he was a galactic sage who was over a thousand years old. So of course he knew that girls were easily hurt, and that they could become trouble very easily. Ike would thus never cheat a girl — take notes, boys.\n\"Having seen the starry host, I thus make star-shaped jewels to remember them by,\" he continued to explain. \"But those stars that shine across the universe do not belong to anyone.

        "165": "Legend has it that the first wine of Mondstadt was brewed in the age when the north wind howled.\n\nIn the age when the Kings of Ice and Frost fought for dominion, Mondstadt's forbears brewed rudimentary wine from wild fruits, even as they shivered in the biting cold. They did so to ease the pain of their frostbitten fingers and to give them the courage to face the harsh and unforgiving ice. For at that time, the land of Mondstadt was engulfed by ice and snow, and the dandelions had not yet reared their heads.\n\nIt is said that the first person in Mondstadt to discover the craft of wine brewing was a grossly negligent guard.\n\nIn a tribe beset by blizzards on all sides, it was the unenviable job of the hardy hunter-gatherers to stock the storage pits with food, and it was the guard's task to guard against intruders.\nThe sight of a human intruder was a rare one indeed in that harsh environment — but there were other creatures who could better withstand the cold, and they would burrow underground to reach the food stocks. The rules of the tribe were that one person should inspect the storage pits at all times, filling in any mouse holes discovered — or better still, catching them red-handed in the act of pilfering — to keep the tribe's food supplies at plentiful levels.\n\nAt that time, the damp, dark caves needed constant care and attention to prevent the food they held from going bad and rotting. On top of this, the mischievous little creatures that hid away out of sight would sometimes play pranks on the guards.\n\nOne day, a wily wind spirit noticed that the grossly negligent guard was once again being grossly negligent. So, the spirit took the form of a fox and crept into a pile of wild apples. There, it caused yeast to grow, ripening the apples and causing them to ferment.\nThe grossly negligent guard was ravenous when he returned, and elected to partake of one of the apples. The mellow taste of fermented fruit delighted both his body and his mind. Immediately, he took animal hide and squeezed the juice from the apples, creating wine.\n\nThe grossly negligent guard who first invented brewing in the age of ice and snow also became Mondstadt's first drunkard. It is said that he was the first person ever to fall into a drunken dream.\n\nIn his first drunken dream, he drunkenly entered the dreams of a lone wolf. Somewhere in the long-lost past or possibly the far-flung future, he fought fang and claw with rival wolf packs, battled with humans for food in the midst of a raging snowstorm, and met the first Seelie.\n\nThe tribe-dwelling human and the pack-dwelling wolf could not bear to live in solitude. This newly brewed wine served to bring man and wolf together in their dreams.\n\nBut their attitudes towards these dreams were poles apart.\n\nThe human who knew only the wind and snow yearned for the wasteland where the lone wolf runs freely, but the lone wolf was fearful of the human's desire. It could not understand why this human was captivated by dangerous illusions and sought hope from within them.\nWhat concerned the wolf even more was that when in a drunken human dream, it could no longer distinguish whether it was a wolf or a human with a wolven spirit.\n\nSo the wolf swore an oath never to touch the humans' poison again, to resist the allure of wine.\nWolves are not the children of the wind, and the land of wine and song is not their home. So the wolves left the humans' domain and settled far off in the wilderness and deep in the mountain forests, places where the scent of wine could not reach them.\n\n\"What you humans call wine, we wolves call the abyss,\"\nThe wolf haughtily concluded.\nBut as the wolf turned towards the drunkard to say this line, it discovered that the drunkard was now lying fast asleep on a bed of pine branches.\n\nThe wolf was most displeased, and violently expelled a puff of air from its nostrils before leaving the still-pungent pile of sleeping human to his business, and going on its way.\n",
        "166": "...\n\nThanks to help from Venerare and... I was finally able to get across... and make it to this mountain peak...\n\nThe peak is the tallest around, and the most dangerous. Forgive my lack of a more poetic description, but from its appearance it would be apt to name it something like \"Pilos Peak.\" But after a simple survey of the terrain, I found that maybe I could use a rope and stakes to climb up from the east face, then use the wind to throw a hook to... and then...\n\n...\n\nNone of the young folks were willing to join me in climbing this mountain. Some were originally eager to give it a try, but were scared off the idea by the older adventurers. \"It is a nightmare from which you cannot awaken,\" they would all say. The failures of those who came before them turned their hearts old before their time, and weakened their resolve. But I am not old yet. My body and mind are in perfectly good shape, and Pilos Peak is just the next mountain on my list of challenges to conquer.\n\n...\n\nGood news! Alrik has agreed to climb the mountain with me. I knew I'd find a kindred spirit eventually!\n\n...\n\nI really underestimated this mountain. Not until I tried to climb it did I realize that there is really no way up. It is like some sort of mysterious gemstone — carved to perfection and flawlessly smooth as it stands there towering in all its glory... I hope the food supplies that the tribe furnished me with will be sufficient to see me to the top.\n\n...\n\nAnother injury. My leg is in very bad shape, and I have two frostbitten fingers on my left hand. At least my right hand is intact. I think it will take me months to recover fully, but now is not the time to give up.\n\n...\n\nBad news. Today, Alrik met his limit. He was too old, and he physically could not cope with the bitterly cold snowstorms and the relentlessly steep terrain this far up the mountain. I held a brief funeral for him, and buried a bottle of his favorite wine alongside him. Just me left now. The blizzard shows no sign of stopping, so I must continue my climb while I can, lest the rocks freeze over...\n\n...\n\nI broke my leg again, but fortunately it was just a minor fracture. I barely escaped being blown into oblivion by a barrage of hailstones from this blizzard. Somehow, I avoided certain death by clinging for dear life to some sharp rocks and finally clawing my way back onto the cliff face. With much difficulty, I think I have found a way down the mountain...\nIf I had been thrown against that wall of ice or become trapped in a crevice, I fear that my luck would have run out... This time it has opened an old wound. I am afraid I will not be able to climb for at least a year after this...\n\n...\n\nThe sky is so blue. I do not expect another snowstorm for at least a few days. I saw a falcon flying straight up into the clouds, very close to the peak of the mountain — the place so high up that I cannot reach it.\n\nIf only I could soar into the sky, just like that falcon...\n\nJust like the baby eagles from the fairy tale, who learned to fly at the summit of a tall mountain...\n\n...\n",
        "167": "—Receiving God—\nOf all the celebrations, ceremonies, and customs of Liyue, none is more iconic than that held in reception of their god: the \"Rite of Descension.\"\nIt is during this rite that the Geo Archon, Liyue's deity and watchful guardian over the ages, descends in person upon the mortal realm to issue his divine proclamations and exhort the people to be guided by the wisdom they contain, so that all things may transpire in accordance with established rules instead of tending towards chaos.\nIn the earliest and humblest days of Liyue's history, Liyue's farmer-forebears would elect community representatives to greet the Geo Archon on arrival and give him an appropriate send-off on departure.\nAfter making lavish offerings and reciting solemn blessings, they would listen in reverence to their god's divine predictions before announcing to the people the vision for their labor in the year ahead. In this way, mortals were guided along the path towards prosperity and to triumph over the obstacles that lay in their way, and thus did the domain of the Geo Archon remain strong and steadfast.\nWhen peace returned once more after the Archon War, the city of Liyue Harbor began to flourish under the government of the Qixing, who represented every trade in Liyue, and who also acted as intermediaries between mortals and their god, taking responsibility for communicating with the Geo Archon, explaining his divine predictions to the people in clear and simple terms, and issuing the official policy for the forthcoming year.\nNaturally, the illustrious individual tasked with hosting the Rite of Descension can only be chosen from among the Qixing, and no-one other than that person is permitted to intervene in the proceedings.\nIn the minds of the many merchants of Liyue Harbor, the divine predictions of Rex Lapis are more precious than the metals and minerals of the mountain mines.\nThus, no matter how far from home they may have strayed by the day that Rex Lapis descends, all will seek to make the journey back in person, or at least send someone in their place, so that they may receive the guidance of the Geo Archon and safeguard their financial fortunes for the year ahead.\nThe raving-mad sages of the nation of rainforests drive themselves to hysterics as they abandon all that is worldly in their pursuit of elusive and esoteric wisdom, but the people of the land of karst cliffs are accustomed to welcoming the generous guidance of their deity as a means towards a worldly end — namely, their continued prosperity.\nIt would seem that, while The Seven stand shoulder-to-shoulder in their roles as Archons of the mortal realm, there are moments where their paths diverge and even run directly counter to one another.",

        "169": "—Wuwang—\nHiding between the jagged peaks in the north of Mt. Qingce is a slope known as Wuwang Hill, a palpably ominous place and the setting of many tales of supernatural phenomena.\nIt is rumored in Liyue that the spirits of the dead lurk within the woods on Wuwang Hill. They roam the perimeter of the decrepit village, wandering among the withering trees and rotting foliage, eternally yearning for things left unresolved in living years. These floating spirits often entice unsuspecting passers-by away from the main path and onto treacherous mountain tracks that lead them tumbling into a river or straight into an ambush of ravenous monsters.\nIt is this phenomenon from which Wuwang Hill derives its name. Wuwang means \"prudence\" in the common tongue, and Wuwang Hill is said to be \"the hill where the prudent are punished.\" For even those travelers who do not act rashly or impulsively on their journey are doomed to be ensnared by the malevolence that lingers here like the mist in the mountain air.\nBoth innocent villagers and ignorant visitors alike are susceptible to the deception of the Wuwang Hill spirits, which draw them deep into dark woods where thick mist blots out the sky and unknown dangers lurk in the shadows. There are many means by which these sinister spirits are able to deceive mortals. Some take the form of bereavement or grief, others of regret, manifesting as voices and visages of the deceased, the love of the departed, or the remorse of another party in an unresolved dispute. The traveler finds themselves compelled to heed the spirit's cry, and follows them into the depths of Wuwang.\nBut Wuwang Hill was not always this way. Some signs of life remained there up until relatively recently, and in times gone by the village at the foot of the slope enjoyed a peaceful and leisurely existence, the chimneys always smoking and the lanterns always lit. That same village stands abandoned today... The buildings are in ruins and all that remains of the villagers is the indistinct murmuring from a realm beyond.\nThere is a fable that is oft-repeated among the children of Qingce Village. It holds that the young people of Wuwang Hill, enchanted by the whale-like song of a faraway sea monster, all threw themselves into the gently flowing Bishui River in pursuit of false promises and childlike dreams. Along the river they floated, making their way to the Sea of Clouds, where they became one with the waves and lost all memory of the woods and their village on the hill... Their dreams, meanwhile, became the sea monster's song.\nGeneration after generation of young people disappeared in this way, until in the end, the sole remaining residents of Wuwang Hill were old and gray. One by one, they left this mortal plane amidst sighs of grief. The bright lights of Liyue Harbor, Rex Lapis's pride and joy, burned ever brighter, while another neglected mountain village turned into a silent ghost town.\nBut unlike the fleeting and fickle human mind, the ever-flowing ley lines remember all. Surging elemental energy takes on spirit form to recreate all the dreams, both fair and foul, of Wuwang Hill's erstwhile residents. Much like a mother who once lost a child and now searches desperately through their irretrievable past for a way to bring everything back, the ley lines — albeit unconsciously — repeatedly recreate the past and those who inhabited it. The way each looked, the way each child cried, the way the elderly would sigh in their twilight years. Each moment of joy, and each moment of sorrow. And like the hypnotic song of the great creatures of the deep sea, it unintentionally lures toward it any nostalgic soul who would dare trespass here.",
        "16": "The fourth poem:\nCeli upa celi\nSada shato lata\nKuzi unu ya zido\nUnu dada\n\nA song sung by samachurls. Judging by the reaction of the chief, the song seems to bear a special philosophical meaning for the hilichurls. It may appear ridiculous in mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention of casting doubt upon well-established views, but I feel obliged to say that the question of whether philosophical discourse truly exists among the hilichurls is one that still fascinates me to this day, and may be deserving of further study.\n\nThe fifth song:\nNini movo muhe yoyo\nNini movo mimi tomo\nLata movo mosi yoyo\nCeli movo celi yoyo\n\nMuch like the people of Mondstadt, the wind-worshiping hilichurl tribes often drink to excess and sing endless songs of praise to the Anemo Archon. This is a hilichurl ode that is often heard when they are inebriated.\n\nThe sixth song:\nUnu, unu\nYaya ika kundala!\nUnu, unu\nMita dada ya dala?\nUnu, unu\nKuzi mita dada ye\nMita dada-a-mimi\n\nA pious ode that is only sung by hilichurls during sacrifices. When performing this ode, the hilichurls often add percussion by beating the backsides of the weakest tribe members with planks, creating rhythmic ringing sounds. It must be quite painful.\n\nThe seventh song:\nMimi movo\nMimi sada\nMimi domu\nDomu upa\nGusha dada\n\nIt appears that many hilichurl tribes share a tradition of exchanging songs around bonfires in the moonlight. This song is one such bonfire ballad sung by the chief at the end of the night. At the end of the song, the chief shouts \"nunu\" three times, which presumably carries the meaning of \"sleep.\"",
        "170": "—Mountain Spirits—\nMany lone seelie are found floating in the mountain forests of Liyue. These glowing spirits are unfailingly found hovering in the mountain mist, in the ruins of ancient cities, or in crumbling, decrepit villages. Should a Vision-bearer draw near, the seelie will guide the way for them, leading them to long-hidden treasure or unfathomably ingenious mechanisms.\nThe people of Liyue believe these tiny, silent spirits to be auspicious sightings, the souls either of departed adepti or unnamed benevolent gods of old. Others believe they are the echoes of strangers without kin, lingering in the mountains to guide lonely, lost visitors onto the path back home.\nAnother old legend told in the mountain villages claims that there was once a time, before the adepti had come into being, when the seelie who meander in the mountains knew an altogether different existence, one in which they had beautiful physical forms and possessed great wisdom. That era, when the seelie roamed the mountains and strolled through the grand halls in the cities of old, is said to date back even further than the days when Rex Lapis fought bitterly against countless rival gods.\nAt a far-flung moment in the distant past, the ancestor of the seelie met a traveler from afar, with whom they swore an oath of union witnessed by the three sisters of the Lunar Palace. Just thirty days later, a sudden disaster struck. The seelie and their lover fled into exile as the world collapsed around them, fleeing until the terrible calamity caught up with and seized them. Their cruel punishment was to be separated from each other for eternity and to have their memories wiped without a trace.\nThe graceful but heartbroken seelie and the sisters grew more sullen and withdrawn with each passing day, to the point where their wondrous forms withered away, leaving fragments of their former selves scattered in the mountains and ruins, where they turned into tiny little life forms. They had forgotten so much, lost so much, and been stripped of their voices and wisdom, yet they continued to sing their same songs of grief. Because of this, still harboring a shred of the deep love they once had for their long-lost lover, they will act as guides to travelers who stop in the mountain mist, seeking to retrace their memories of an ancient story in long-abandoned ruins, disused makeup cabinets, and now-undecipherable poetry.\nOf course, these are nothing but clumsy, incoherent folk tales, wild and fantastical conjecture about what Liyue may have been like in the distant past before the time of Rex Lapis. Needless to say, such tales have no credibility whatsoever. The true origin of these sorrowful spirits that meander in the mountains is, however, still widely debated, and no consensus has ever been reached on the topic.",
        "171": "...\n\nCommerce and trade, like springs and streams, begin with the mountains and end with the seas. The penchant of people is to pursue profit, and when people turn their means to profitable ends, wealth is created. To possess means is to possess power, and to curb the unjust excesses of power, we restrain it with contracts to guide all things to prosper together. The strong should not bully the weak, nor should weakness be despised and strength glorified. Let it be known to all that trade and commerce allows the river of gold to flow unimpeded along its natural course — this is the just and upright way.\nSome say: \"There are those who lose their jobs and have no reliable source of food, nor a roof over their heads, they toil in vain in their barren fields. All the while, the wealthy merchants' residences overflow with gold and jade. What justice and uprightness is this?\"\nThis question is devoid of insight. Like the waves that face off against the golden sands of the shoreline, the pursuit of profit topples much of what stands in its way, and like the rapids that run in the valleys, it is unrelenting. Thus those in poverty will not stay poor forever, just as the wealthy shall not hold onto their riches for eternity — but the treasury must always be filled for the nation to remain peaceful and prosperous.\nHence, it is the proper way of things to eschew prohibition, expand the economy, and reform the government. It is easy to succumb to complacency in the matter of aid, but this must not become the trend and should be curtailed. The Millelith should be expanded to pacify unrest, both the bandits at our borders and the citizens who reside within them.\n\n...\n\nThough Rex Lapis enjoys immortality, mortals require provisions and preparation to be free of worry. This grand plan charts the course that will lead us, slowly but surely, to Liyue's longevity and the people's prosperity. The task of reform is one that should be undertaken with patience — we cannot make rash demands, lest we overlook other concerns. Just as one who carves by candlelight patiently waits for the jade to take shape, so will it take time for the myriad affairs of Liyue to be gradually settled.",
        "172": "—Silk Flowers—\nFor the well-to-do citizens of Liyue, the Silk Flower has a ubiquitous presence in their lives: It has a beautiful color and its soft petals can be processed to make silk. It also has a most delightful scent that can survive multiple rounds of processing, and even the weaving process itself. For this reason, Liyue's botanists have cultivated a special strain for exclusive use in perfume making — with the most luxurious perfumes being offered first and foremost, of course, to Rex Lapis for his approval.\nFor the women of Liyue, highly prized Silk Flower perfumes are seen as holding different symbolic meanings based on the fragrance profile and composition. The unwritten rule in Liyue is that it is impolite to broach the topic of perfume with a woman in normal social interaction, but also that if an admirer is able to correctly guess the type of perfume one is wearing, as well as correctly deduce its unique properties and characteristics, all whilst conveying this in an articulate and tactful manner, the admirer is more likely to stand a chance of winning one's affection.\nA popular belief in the rural regions of Liyue is that the method for decocting Silk Flower perfume was originally taught to mortals by an adeptus living as a hermit on Mt. Aocang. In the age where divine beings coexisted alongside lowly mortals, the adeptus guided humans to learn the ways of courting and romancing from the birds, beasts, and plants. To a young woman bathing in a spring, it once took the form of a graceful illuminated bird, teaching her the exotic techniques of decocting and applying fragrant oils.\nWho was this young woman capable of stirring the heart of an adeptus living in deliberate seclusion from the world? With countless legends offering different versions of the story, the truth is impossible to know. But the art of decocting perfume from Silk Flowers was indeed passed on, for it survives to this very day. It is claimed that the subtle undertones of the perfume's scent and the gentle-but-nimble hand techniques used in the decoction process have remained unchanged throughout history on account of having proved themselves supremely fit for purpose time and time again.\nAs they grow, Silk Flowers will exhibit different properties based on how their environmental conditions differ from their ancestral habitat. Liyue's merchants have coined plenty of tasteless terms for Silk Flowers of all types and uses. They tend to attribute them to Rex Lapis, claiming they once had the fortune to encounter him during one of his excursions in the mortal realm or pass them off as a merciful gift from an adeptus, such details always featuring as part of a wondrous, fantastical narrative. Sales tactics like these always manage to garner the interest of a shopper or two on their way through Liyue Harbor.\nHigh demand has pushed Liyue's merchants towards the mass cultivation of Silk Flowers and the ongoing breeding of new strains. This means that the striking sight of beautiful Silk Flowers is a common one in all highly populated areas, including the city and the towns. Sadly, geographical changes over Liyue's long history and ever-expanding mining activity have conspired to destroy the natural habitat of wild Silk Flowers, meaning that the flower is all but extinct in rural areas. The handful that can still be found in the wild are carefully looked after by adepti living in seclusion there. These Silk Flowers feature daintier, more elegant blossoms, which puts them in stark contrast to those cultivated by horticulturalists in urban centers.\nInterestingly, the people of Liyue see the pretty and sweet-smelling Silk Flower as one of the many symbols of Rex Lapis. Which begs the question: Has this mighty and imposing god, who typically takes a decidedly masculine form on his excursions to the mortal realm, ever taken the form of a woman and accepted a ritual offering in the form of a bunch of flowers? The sparse historical records on the one hand and the plethora of rumors of obscure origin on the other means that, while this claim is more or less impossible to verify, it also cannot be simply dismissed as baseless speculation.\nOn a personal note — the writer has, on one occasion, personally witnessed a Statue of The Seven accept a carefully prepared and distinctly feminine gift that was presented to it in worship. As for the Geo Archon's innermost feelings upon receiving offerings from their subjects, however, this is not something that I, as an outsider in Liyue, consider myself qualified to comment on.",

And only then will the arrogance of those who conspire to rebel be put to rest once and for all.\n\nBased on an inscription, we decided to abandon our original plans of exploring <color=#FFE14BFF>the cellar in the southwestern ruins</color> in favor of going to a locked secret chamber.\nAccording to the inscription text deciphered by Master Eberhart, the chamber should contain impressive ancient frescoes along with weapons forged from Starsilver.\nIf that's the case, this could easily be the most significant archaeological discovery in decades.\n\nThat's what Master Ingbert said, at least. But somehow my heart still can't forget the companions we lost in the snowstorm just days before.\nI sincerely hope that Master Eberhart was right when he said that they were aristocratic children rigorously trained from childhood, and perfectly capable of making their way back to camp on their own.\n\nWe shall soon set off from <color=#FFE14BFF>South Base Camp</color> to delve further into the inner reaches of the ruins.\nThis time, it is imperative that we closely examine the stability of the ruins before we enter.",

Perhaps this is the true tenacity of a young aristocrat.\nMaster Landrich's judgment seems to have been well-founded.\nEven as an illegitimate child, he is quite capable of living up to the role of an aristocrat, more so than most other aristocrats, in fact.\n\nWhen the storm eases a little, we will proceed to the <color=#FFE14BFF>the cellar in the southwestern ruins</color> as per Eberhart's proposal.\nBased on the content of what he deciphered, there may be something very ancient within.\nThe sheer cold of this place has the peculiar and incomprehensible effect of preserving things the way they are.\n\nWe must not let down the companions we lost.\n...And more importantly, we must not let Master Landrich down.\nOtherwise, I will most likely be facing off against monsters in the gladiatorial arena before too long.\nEven if I beat the monsters, I would probably share the fate of Eberhart's slave, and meet my demise at the sword of the red-haired reaper of the Lawrence Clan...",

It shouldn't be much further to the camp.\nLesson learned — in the future, prepare for each and every conceivable eventuality before thinking about setting foot on the mountain...",
        "181": "—Dragonspine—\nI began my ascent of Dragonspine from its southern side, where the mountain meets the riverbanks and plains of Liyue. The mountain slopes gently here, the wind is soft, and the snow is light. Added to the unfrozen water sources, it makes this place a good choice for setting up a base camp. Once I have prepared my supplies, I will make a camp here before continuing my climb to the summit.\n\nAfter setting up camp, I took the chance to survey the surrounding ruins. What intrigued me is that the architectural style and artistic patterns are strikingly similar to those seen in ancient buildings elsewhere. This could very well mean that the fabled mountain civilization of old is right beneath my feet.\nUnfortunately, I did not find any well-preserved inscriptions within the ruins, so there was no hard proof of the ancient civilization's historicity. Perhaps I will find more information is preserved further up the mountain, buried deep within the bitingly cold blizzards.\n\nSpending the night here is an unpleasant experience. The cold, damp wind chills to the bone, and the way it shakes the tent sounds like the roar of a rushing river. Guaranteed nightmare material for once you do manage to fall asleep. There's a cave by the water, and it must be spacious in there because I can hear the ghostly groaning of the wind echoing inside. Unfortunately, the entrance is tightly fenced off and there is simply no way to get through from the outside.\n\nI will start advancing further up the mountain a little later on. There are some remnants of the relatively recent past by the path, which if I'm not mistaken can be traced back to the era when Mondstadt was ruled by an aristocracy. I dug up some fragments of clothing and some irreparably damaged weaponry. The dense snow and ice seem to have slowed down the decomposition process, preserving any pieces of the past that they swallow up for a long time to come.\nThe way that the items are distributed leads me to believe that a chase once took place here on this mountain path — or possibly even a murder.\n\nIt seems that even fierce blizzards and sinister mutations pose no obstacle to humans intent on following through on their dark ambitions. In the end, this archon-forsaken snowscape has become stained by mortal transgression.\n\nAs I climb further up the path, the wind becomes stronger and the temperature plummets to an unbearably low level. I scouted out a ruin to the northeast, where to my utter astonishment I found water! It was somehow unfrozen, in defiance of its perennially blizzard-beaten surroundings. From the location, I would estimate that it is linked to the stream I saw further downhill.\nHowever, this area is so cold that I could not afford to explore deeper inside the ruin for the risk of freezing to death or drowning. I left a makeshift sign there to mark the spot — I just hope that it doesn't get buried in the snow.\nI suppose that once upon a time this could have been an underground shelter and that over the years the groundwater has seeped in and flooded it. But I have also heard that the tyrants of the distant past were partial to a form of punishment whereby they would jail a prisoner, lock them in a cage, and then slowly pour water in. Just so they could force the prisoner to watch in alarm as the water slowly rose up from their ankles to their mouth, nose, and finally their forehead...\nSuch a cruel and drawn out punishment... And in the sheer cold of this climate, it is all the more impossible to imagine that any managed to survive it.\n\nFurther to the east, the road becomes more rugged. I had a stupid accident and very nearly broke my leg because of it. I was lucky to only receive a superficial wound and no major bone injury. But it also tore a great big hole in my windproof clothing, so now I feel the full force of the wind right against my skin. It feels awful, like being stabbed constantly with a sharp knife.\nI managed to find shelter from the wind before my wound went completely numb. I just about managed to sew my clothing back up, but there's no way I can continue to the summit like this.\nI made it back to camp, finally, on the verge of freezing to death. As I warmed my feet by the bonfire, I removed my socks to find that three of my toes had turned purple from the cold... But no matter, right now I'm still enjoying the feeling of coming back to life after such a close brush with death.\n\nWhen the storm died down a little, I looked up and caught a view of the peak, towering there silently against the dark sky, encircled by giant jagged rocks and yet secluded among them in the center. The bards' songs tell of an ancient, evil dragon who lies buried there in the mountain stream — I wonder if it, too, yearns for the celestial heights even as it gazes up with its rotting and blinded eyes?\nMany villagers who live at the foot of the mountain liken this monstrous mountain to a blind spot in the eyes of the gods, a place ruled by the inscrutable force of fate. Old Mondstadt fairy tales speak of the mountain as a place of punishment that was abandoned by the Wind of Time and left for the howling winds to sweep in and freeze everything in its moment of destruction.\nYet something still stirs here, at the peak of the mountain. I heard its call in my dream. It was like a gentle song, pleasing to the ear, but somehow disturbing to the mind.\n\nThis trip was a disaster, but at least I came out of it alive. Farewell for today, Dragonspine. Perhaps I shall return, though I do not know if I will ever make it to your summit...\nI think I will explore Liyue next. But first things first, my top priority is replenishing my lost supplies. Oh, and while I'm at it, I think I'll swap this soggy old diary for a nice new one.",

        "184": "—Qilin—\nAmong the legends that circulate in the mountains of Liyue, the qilin are a type of noble and benevolent illuminated beast. Qilin often roam the mountain forests, but appear only on nights where starlight shines upon clear dew. For sustenance, they drink only spring water and eat only fragrant herbs.\nQilin are gentle illuminated beasts, with grace and elegance flowing through their veins. It is said that qilin will never harm living things, refusing even to step on an insect or break a blade of grass. People believe that a qilin's characteristics, behavior, and their every movement is dictated by an age-old etiquette that has remained unchanged for a thousand years.\nFollowing the barbarous age of the Archon War, many adepti became unable to continue living among the clamorous world of mortals. As a result, and under the direction of Rex Lapis, they withdrew themselves from society to live in seclusion in the bamboo groves and mountains. No longer would they interfere in the human world, content instead to enjoy a realm of mountains and water and pursue their own interests.\nYet some illuminated beasts there were that, over a thousand years of mortal cooperation, had cultivated deep friendships with ordinary humans. They decided to carry out the will of the Lord of Geo in the mortal realm, assisting human society with their adeptal powers and charity. Some hid in mountain hamlets, others walked the bustling city streets. They lived together and mixed with humankind, leaving behind unique bloodlines in Liyue Harbor.\n\nAccording to one folktale, as early as several thousand years ago, there were already those among the elegant qilin who had begun to grow deeply attached to the savage mortals.\nThe tale tells of how in that barbaric era, the people wore clothes of water lotus and bay leaf.\nOne night, a herb gatherer was bathing in a mountain pool, when to his surprise, a passing qilin began to eat the clothes that he had left by the water's edge. The illuminated beast was too young to understand human notions of shame and privacy and had yet to learn the conduct of illuminated beasts in the mortal realm.\nTo make up for her crude behavior and to avoid startling the vulnerable mortal with her otherworldly adeptal appearance, she transformed into one of human bearing. As the pale light of the full moon fell onto the pool, she appeared before the herb gatherer.\nThe young illuminated beast ultimately did not understand human notions of shame and privacy. She stood in that mountain forest, lit by cold moonlight and the glow of fireflies, clothed only in dewdrops and the lunar gleam. Together with the ignorant mortal she traveled, strolling happily among flowers and bamboo groves, revealing to him the mountain dwelling of the adepti, interpreting for him the language of the birds, sleeping lightly amid the cry of insects, sinking softly into shared and ancient dreams...\nAs the herb gatherer began to stir at the first light of dawn, he awoke to find that the noble illuminated beast had vanished without a trace.\n\nAs for how this tale unfolds, opinions vary widely. Some people say that one night, the qilin placed a bamboo basket outside the front door of the herb gatherer's home, before disappearing into the moonlit mist. When the herb gatherer came to the door, he found a child soundly asleep inside the basket.\nOthers say that from that moment on the qilin lived together with the mortal, gave birth to children, and grew accustomed to human life.\n\nNo matter the truth of the thousand-year-old matter, the elegant illuminated beasts continue to walk among the residents of Liyue, unseen among the sea of people, waiting for the day when Rex Lapis calls them forth once again.",
        "185": "—Hidden Jade—\nIn the valley northwest of Liyue Harbor and south of Nantianmen lie many silent, ancient ruins.\nOne of these areas is known as the Dunyu Ruins. This area is said to have already existed even before the time of the Archon Wars.\nAccording to old legends passed by word of mouth, \"Dunyu\" means \"the land to which beauteous jade flees.\"\nIn a past beyond memory, when even Rex Lapis would still have been young, a star fell from the sky into the barren plains west of Liyue. These plains were transformed into a huge and deep chasm in the wake of that star's descent, and jade would emerge from within, beautiful and limitless, and it would become the foundation for a thousand years of industrial mining in Liyue thereafter.\nLegend has it that when that nameless star fell, a fragment of it broke off and crashed into the rocks in northern Lisha.\nAs most know, wordless stones harbored soul and spirit, and in manners and times not witnessed by mortal eyes they watched and listened to the ley lines' pulses, the echoes of the alpine springs, and the slow but inexorable movements of the mountains.\nBut unlike the ordinary but enduring stone of the earth, the fragments of the meteorite that fell from heaven had a proud and agitated temper.\n\nLater, when countless gods and rulers fought over the appointed celestial seats, and the very stars and abyss themselves faded, tragedy and evil embarred the breath of the waters and mountains. The fallen star could bear this no longer, and heedless of the great chasm's persuasions to stay it leaped away, away towards the heavens.\nAs it returned to the skies, the heavenly jade left behind a deep pit, within which humans would build great cities and mighty fortresses, finding refuge and shutting themselves in with the leftover inheritance of that fallen star.\nOver the tumult and storms of the next few thousand years, the redoubts of the Dunyu Valley stood tall and maintained prosperous relations with Liyue Harbor up till 500 years ago.\nBut with the coming of the black calamity and the rise of the Abyss, the residents of Dunyu sealed the ancient city and departed for other lands. None know why these refugees chose to shut the gates of their home, and even the millennia-old adepti and yaksha are silent on this matter.\nAnd so, the sealed fortresses became giant, silent tombs, with naught left in them but the sound of pond water and the wind whistling through empty halls — and thusly, too, did they come to be called the \"Dunyu Ruins\" by the people of Liyue.",

        "187": "The land of Liyue was not always ruled by Rex Lapis. Many gods walked the land in that distant epoch.\n\nThe area known as the Guili Plains was once an area lush with Glaze Lilies. But it was beset by troubles on every side, forcing its residents of old to flee, while the prosperity of Liyue Harbor would attract many of those who took their place. But even so, many tales of gallantry continue to circulate in these wilds.\n\nIn the tales of traveling merchants and porters, there was once a mysterious figure that would surface in the dead of night upon the plains: it was a maiden in a long indigo robe, striding along the shallows of the Bishui River, the moon wrapping her face with silver light as the night wind carried her words up to the shimmering, sleepless stars.\n\nAccording to guests at Wangshu Inn, only those who get lost amid the firefly-lights on summer nights might see her, and only those who can discern the scent of Glaze Lilies amid the dancing lights and Seelie floating in the dark could find her tracks. Some guessed that she might be a lost illuminated beast, or a sole servant of some long-dead god, gently mourning her master only at night. And some also believed her to simply be a gallant hero, like those who spurn civilization, hiding their real names.\n\nNo one knows how her story began, but it ended with the tale of a certain hunter. But unlike the stories of those merchants, the hunter encountered her brandishing a sword against several perilous shadows under the merciless moonlight. After an elegant and sharp dance, the maiden was nowhere to be seen, with naught left but a pile of bloodied dust.\nThe next day, some inquisitive citizens would discover the corpses of Millelith and land surveyors by the river.\nAfter this, no matter how many search parties the Ministry of Civil Affairs would send, no one saw that riverside maiden ever again.\n\nPerhaps that deadly dance was the fruit of some vendetta, or perhaps that woman had herself been some great brigand. Or perhaps that matter does not require any rhyme or reason at all. Heroes are heroes, after all, drawing their blades for reasons beyond common comprehension.\n\nBut as the lights of Liyue Harbor consumed the deserted countryside villages day by day, this legend too would slowly disappear.\nStill, the legends hold that the riverbank that maiden had used to roam remains filled with blooming Glaze Lilies to this day.",

Like, want.\nNote: You will not generally hear hilichurls say that they like you, so translating this as \"want\" is sufficient.\n\nUseful Phrases:\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Gusha\"</color>\n1. Vegetables, grasses, fruits. Disliked things.\nNote: Aside from eating plants, \"mosi gusha\" can also express unhappiness.\nIf a hilichurl says \"Gusha\" to you, you must use their tone of voice to determine if they want fruits, rice, or wheat, or if they are dissatisfied.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Mita\"</color>\n1. Meat, delicious foods.

In short, this word is difficult to explain.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Celi\"</color>\n1. Hot. Something that is hot. Fire.\n2. Occasionally \"sun\"; \"Celi upa\" without \"upa\" can also mean \"sun.\"\nNote: \"Celi lata\" is an unusual figure of speech as it implies both cold and heat.\nThis phrase generally refers to things that emit light but not heat. For example, \"Celi lata gusha\" is \"Small Lamp Grass,\"\nAnd \"Celi lata\" can describe things such as fireflies, stars, or the moon.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Kucha gusha/Unu gusha\"</color>\n1. Seed.\nNote: It may be hard to believe that I would list such a word. Hilichurls do not specifically practice farming, but they have a habit of stockpiling seeds. Sometimes when they are in a good mood, they will find a place and bury their seeds. \"Kucha\" means \"small,\" and carries a slightly contemptuous connotation in Hilichurlian. \"Unu\" is the number \"one\" and is a holy word that embodies the hilichurls' concept of gods and the origin of life. Both of these terms can be used to describe a seed, which is fascinating.\nBy the way, \"Du\" is two, \"Unu du\" is three, and \"Dudu\" is four. Can you guess what five is?\nThe correct answer is \"Mani,\" which also means \"hands\" or \"physical labor.\"\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Sada\"</color>\n1. Solid, hard.\nNote: In Hilichurlian, \"Upa sada\" means that you are prepared to do something.\n\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Boya\"</color>\n1. Used with certain words to denote colors.\nNote: According to my tests, \"Celi boya\" is red, \"Gusha boya\" is green, \"Lata boya\" is blue, \"Nini boya\" is white, \"Nunu boya/Sama boya\" are black, and \"Unu boya\" is yellow.\n\nTime and Directions:\n <color=#00E1FFFF>\"Aba mosi dada\"</color>\n1.

Where did this thing go?\nNote: After some thought, I have decided to omit Hilichurlian directional words from this handbook. Hilichurls do not have absolute directions, so their directional speech is relative. However, the subject in their responses depends on their attitude towards you.

When was the last time anything fun happened here?\"\n\"Funny you should say that, a new family did move into our village recently...\"\n\"Novelty and fun aren't the same thing!\"\nDespite what she had said, Vera decided to pay a visit to the newcomers. Sachi, however, remembered his family's rules, and walked back home for dinner.\n\n...\nVera gave the door to the newcomer's abode a gentle push. Much to her surprise, it wasn't locked.\n\"Anybody home?\"\nNo sooner had the words left her mouth than the living room cupboard doors flew open and out jumped a black-haired boy wearing glasses. He was followed by a tentacled blue slime.\n\"Make way! Tal, why did you let a stranger in?\"\nThe black-haired boy gently pushed Vera out of his way, and picked up an axe by the door.\n\"You leave me with no choice.

The compilation is the result of the tireless work of scholars who have recorded and arranged countless songs sung by Mondstadt bards.\nBards often elaborate upon or fabricate history to draw in an audience and earn a few extra Mora. Hence, most of their works have extremely low credibility. What has allowed the songs to remain popular to this day, and to stand the test of the thousand winds of time, is the threads of spectacular imagination and ingenious rhetoric that have been woven into them.\n...\n\"What is to be sung hails from ancient times.\"\n\"The gods walked among us in their prime.\"\nThe poet, who had finished recounting the tales of the ruins and Vennessa, began to tell the story of the Wind Dragon. He began to sing, \"The story to be told hails from ancient times, when the gods walked among us in their prime.\" The dragon graced by Anemo was born* in the high heavens in that age of wonders. He slowly descended, and inspected everything with curious eyes.\nHe landed in a village, but the terrified villagers threw rocks at him. The dragon could not understand why they cried out in fear.\nHe landed in a cemetery, and only heard the lament of grieving people. The dragon could not understand what they murmured in their sorrow.\nHe landed in an orchard, but was cursed by the furious farmers who lost their trees. The dragon could not understand why they screamed in anger.\nThe world was too complicated for a young dragon. The dragon was bewildered, yet he did not give up.\nOne day, the dragon heard music pouring out from the Holy Lyre der Himmel. This was the name of the lyre belonging to the Anemo Archon. Enchanted by the poetry, the Wind Dragon landed beside the best singer under the skies.\nPeople panicked, for the mighty elemental dragons and the great archons that reigned over the earth had never seen eye to eye.\n\"Behold his beauty and benignity!\" The Windborne Bard sang.\n\"But we do not know him,\" the people replied.\nWhat mysterious magic lies behind music and poetry that has the power to mesmerize both dragons and humans alike? I, for one, cannot fathom it. The dragon decided to stay with the bard, for he too wished to be understood by all souls. He learned human speech and the Windborne Bard's singing techniques.\n...omitted...\nLater generations regarded him as one of the Four Winds that watched over and protected Mondstadt.\n\n\"An atrous sun befell its kingdom and a luminous pearl lost its glow.\"\n\"Niveous silk grew dim and wheaten gold burned brilliantly no more.\"\nSo begins another tale that occurred in the lost Khaenri'ah Kingdom.\nThe Eclipse Dynasty had fallen, and disaster spread across the land. The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their own greed and ambition, and created an army of shadowy monsters with their uncanny powers. Durin, a black serpentine dragon, rose from the sea to cast its shadow over Mondstadt. But it was at this very moment that there was no-one to inherit the title of Lionfang Knight, thus, the Knights of Favonius could not fly their falcon flag.\nThe persistent yet despondent prayers called upon the archon of Mondstadt, the Windborne Bard. The strings of the lyre were strummed once more, and the Wind Dragon was summoned forth.\nAs Mondstadt's last line of defense, the Wind Dragon battled the wicked dragon to the death in the raging storms.\nThe Wind Dragon prevailed. He tore open the throat of the wicked dragon, at the cost of ingesting its poisonous blood. The blood of the wicked dragon was distorted gold, with the powers to crumble mountains and poison the earth.\nThe Wind Dragon protected Mondstadt with his life, and his only wish was to be understood by humans. And so, he drifted off into a deep slumber.\nThe Holy Lyre played a sorrowful tune.\nThe Holy Lyre sang: should you awaken, spread your wings and live your life freely! A dragon is born to soar the skies, and mortals shall surely grasp your beauty...\n\n(*Typically, when life arises from the elements, it either descends and becomes a slime, or ascends and becomes a crystalfly. Rarely does this process give rise to dangerous elemental monsters. Elemental dragons are rarely seen and have the powers to match the gods of old.)",

Bless our King! As long as he reigns over us, we will never starve!\"\n\"Oink, oink! Bless the gentle Anemo Archon for giving our King such a kind and polite Princess!\"\n\n(There are some words in the margin written in tiny handwriting: \"dada, if I dont eat candy efery night, and i pray eferyday, will i turn into a wild piggy? i want to be a wild piggy because they are so tasty\")",

It's freezing! My claws are going to shatter!\"\nEven the bravest, strongest Boar King could not withstand the frigid tundra.\n\"Oink, oink, oink!

Woobaka despised everything nice, and swore to transform beauty into ugliness and turn light into dark.\nAt the sight of the joyful wolf, anger boiled inside him. He cursed:\n\"Squeak! Squeak! Angry am I! I shall spike his heart with the coldest ice, and he will never again know the meaning of hope!\"\nWith that said, Woobakwa began to curse the pup with his magic.\nBut the rash pup gobbled him up, just like that, without the slightest warning.\nWoobakwa was so furious that he cursed the pup using the most foul and insulting words ever uttered by a squirrel. The pup felt the noise coming from his mouth, and only then did he realize his mistake.\n\"Aroo, I'm so sorry, mister squirrel, I thought you were edible!\"\nThe pup wished to apologize to the squirrel, but he felt his throat tighten and then loosen. The squirrel slid down to his stomach with a gulp.\n\n(A sheet of paper bearing fine handwriting is taped to this page: \"Lily, this is why you should eat cautiously when you're outside.\")",
        "24": "No-one knew just what chemical reaction occurred in the pup's stomach, but Woobakwa's curse magically came into effect!\nBecause of the curse, the pup's heart was pierced and frozen by an icicle. The pup became cold and mean forever after, and whenever other animals showed kindness to him, he would repay them with the harshest of words or the most woeful of deeds. In the end, every animal loathed him.\nFrom then on, every wolf in the forest spoke of the pup in this way:\n\"Woof, what a selfish wolf he is! Such an obnoxious kid.\"\n\"Woof, woof, what a heartless wolf he is! Let us stay away from him.\"\nOne by one, the pup lost all his friends. The forest welcomed the lonely pup no more, so he had no choice but to head north.\nThe blizzards that blew in the northern tundra kept most creatures away. But with his heart already frozen solid, the pup was no longer afraid of the cold.\nHe decided to settle down there, and became the lone wolf that roamed the tundra.\n\n(A young girl has written in the corner of the page: \"Dada, but where did Woobakwa go?\")",
        "25": "One day, the Boar Princess heard about the pup and was deeply saddened by his story.\nSo she asked her people for advice on how to defrost his heart and turn him back to his former sweet self.\nShe asked and asked, but only the wise fox and the elderly turtle knew the answer:\n\"Ack-ack-ack! Only sincerity and fire could melt such evil ice. Ack-ack-ack!\" The fox replied.\n\"Friendship demands sacrifice. No friendships come without sacrifices. I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds,\" the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle said.\nThe clever Boar Princess knew right away what she had to do. She dried her tears and curtsied to the two wise animals:\n\"Oink oink! Thank you! I would like for you to come and see the pup with me, so that you can be the first to witness our friendship!\"\nWhen the fox and the turtle heard the Boar Princess was willing to invite them on a royal trip, their hearts were filled with joy. They set out with the Princess and headed north.\n\n(A handwritten note, seemingly from the young girl's father, is taped to the page: \"Turtles can't make noises, no matter how hard they try.

You have come at the right moment, for I haven't had lunch yet!\"\nHearing his words, the kind Boar Princess could not help but shed tears. Her warm tears seemed to melt a little of the ice at the tip of the pup's heart.\n\"Aroo! Why are you crying?\"\n\"Oink, oink! You are going to starve out here — I have never seen such misery in my kingdom!\"\n\"I will sacrifice everything to feed your hungry belly!\"\nThe pup was stupefied by her words.\n\"Arooooooo! Miss, you must be mad! No-one has ever dared say such a thing to me!\"\nBut when the pup saw the determination in her eyes, his frozen heart melted some more.\n\"Nope! That's why...\"\n\"I will sacrifice two of the wisest and most caring members of my family just to feed you! It is for the sake of our friendship!\"\nThe fox knew what horror she meant and attempted to run, but he was pinned to the ground by the pup and the Boar Princess. Grandpa Turtle was so frightened by the sight that he retreated into his shell.\nThe pup and the Boar Princess enjoyed a delicious appetizer of fox out in the snow. Next, they found a cave, picked a few mushrooms, built a fire with some moss, and treated themselves to a tasty turtle soup.\nThe pup felt the delight of sharing and making friends for the first time he could remember. His frozen heart melted completely, and he shed tears of joy.\nThe Princess took the pup by his paw, and the two merrily returned to their home.\n\n(Wedged between the last two pages is a card bearing elegant handwriting: \"Honey, I think it would be best if we donated this one to the library...\")",
        "27": "In the time of the aristocrats, there stood a high tower in Mondstadt's plaza. It was built to honor Barbatos the Anemo Archon in name, yet in reality it was nothing more than a flamboyant display of wealth and power by the royals to gloat over the commoners. The one time in the year that the commoners living in these dark times could find a little solace was during Ludi Harpastum.\nDuring one Ludi Harpastum, a wandering singer from a distant land arrived in the city. The name of the lass was Inès, and everyone at the festival was enchanted by her stunning beauty. People of all ages and all walks of life vied to catch a glimpse of her throwing the Harpastum and to hear her sing foreign ballads.\n\n\"The blessings of Barbatos are for everyone! You are only sinful if you are bitter at such a joyous occasion!\"\n\nAs she sang these verses, she handed out her earnings during the festival to the poor and orphans in the city.\nA frail figure stood among the crowds. He was the Seneschal, and he fell for her at first sight. But his religious piety filled him with a frustration at his inability to suppress the emotions he was experiencing, and her acts of charity, which violated the Church's right to aid to the poor, irked him all the more.\nAs is known to all, the beliefs of contemporary Mondstadters hold that the Anemo Archon Barbatos encourages people to seek love and pursue freedom, but in the dark ages the Anemo Archon slept, and the city was tormented by the tyranny of the nobles, the poverty of the commoners, and the ravage of the dragon; meanwhile, the self-proclaimed \"orthodox\" church — a mere figurehead, controlled by the ruling class — advocated abstinence from earthly pleasures to avert divine punishment. Under such circumstances, even the harp which symbolized the wind had been restricted to playing only those songs deemed \"holy.\" However, the notion of \"divine punishment\" was little more than an excuse fabricated by the nobles to conceal their avarice and restrict the commoners.\n\n\"To let her stay in the city is to bewitch all its inhabitants. What wickedness will this witch bring?\" The Seneschal pondered.\n\nAnd so, the Seneschal plotted to hunt down Inès, and to confine her to the Cathedral while awaiting further instructions. As per the traditions of the time, the maiden chosen to throw the Harpastum should serve at the royal court for three days after the celebration, under the protection of the aristocrats. The Seneschal decided to send his adopted son, Octave, to sneak into the royal court and abduct Inès.\nOctave was an unwelcome child, abandoned by his superstitious parents at birth and later raised by the Seneschal. As a child, he was persecuted and abused by the citizens, seen as a bad omen of draconic disasters. The only person who protected Octave was the Seneschal, who treated him like his own son and thus won his utmost trust.\n\n\"Bring the maiden who threw the Harpastum yesterday to me! Disturb no-one and do not mention my name.\"\n\nUnder orders from the Seneschal, Octave climbed onto the balcony of the court chambers at nightfall. Upon seeing the girl weeping in the moonlight, his pure heart was stirred, for he had never seen such a wondrous sight. He gazed at the girl, leaving his task forgotten.\nBut the silence of the tranquil moment shared by Octave and the girl was interrupted by the servants...",

The tradition of worshiping the Four Winds was gradually formed in Mondstadt. However, Dvalin, the ancient Wind Dragon, predated them all.\n\nApproximately one hundred years ago, the land was in chaos. Darkness spread, contaminating everything it touched. Barbarians and foul creatures roamed the lands, forcing people to dwell within the city walls.\nIt was an especially difficult time for Mondstadt. The Lionfang Knight was without a suitable heir, and the Knights of Favonius had lost many of its brave men and women during the bitter wars. During the most difficult of times, Durin, the corrupted dragon of immeasurable power, began attacking Mondstadt.\nThe prayers of Mondstadt's people awoke the Anemo Archon, and his will summoned forth the Wind Dragon Dvalin. As the last defender of Mondstadt, Dvalin battled Durin with all his might.\nThe result was clear — Durin's remains still lie atop the snowy peaks to the south of Mondstadt — but the story of how the battle ended was lost in time. It is said that Dvalin ripped out Durin's throat, and together they fell from the sky. Durin's body sunk into the snow while Dvalin was summoned by the Anemo Archon and fell into a slumber.\n...\nPeople used to believe that Dvalin would awaken whenever Mondstadt faces a new threat.\nBut in these times of peace, the belief of the Four Winds has gradually eroded and their temples lie all but completely deserted.\n\n(Citation of unknown origin: By the time the Knights finally discovered that the foreign monstrosity named Stormterror, with which they had clashed countless times, was in fact Dvalin of the Four Winds, the enmity that had grown between them and driven them to conflict could not be undone. One can scarcely imagine the betrayal Dvalin must have felt when he awoke after a hundred years of slumber only to find that the people of Mondstadt, whom he had protected with his life, had forsaken him...)",

Only there could the people bask in the bright moonlight and enjoy the grace it brought to the living.

For the rest of their lives, they were tormented by a curse that made them feel as if they were being cooked in a huge cooking pot, unable to ever see the light of day again.\nHowever, during the celebration, one of the pygmies wrapped the Prince in the dirty tablecloth, intent on carrying him back to the dark forest to seek help from the Princess, hoping to wake him up.

He wields a sword that heralds the dawn and wears armor that can reflect the shining sunlight. He shall destroy my kingdom and bring the Prince back to life. The Princess will then be free from her eternal torment. Until then, I fear not a single soul in the Land of Night, for nothing will bring an end to my kingdom except for the catastrophe foretold by the prophecy. As for you, the treacherous slave that poisoned his master... fate shall see that you get what you deserve.\"\nThe Night Mother then collapsed and became a pile of sludge consisting of mud and worms.\nDevastated, the pygmy wandered around in sorrow and regret. He hid the body in a tree hole and walked off alone into the night, and into a self-imposed exile.",
        "36": "Many years later, when Gothson's ankle would become trapped in the same unlucky beast trap he had laid, he must have recalled the afternoon when his father had taken him into the city to take part in Ludi Harpastum.\nGothson's whole life was, without a doubt, unfortunate. But he could never quite recall when his misfortunes had begun. He spent his childhood in Springvale, under the protection of the spring fairy. Indeed, all the hunters lived peaceful and carefree lives.\nWhen Gothson was seven summers old, his father took him to Mondstadt to watch the circus at Ludi Harpastum. This was the first time Gothson had entered the city in his life. He was held spellbound by the aromas of sweets and roasted meats, the brilliant lights and colored paper, the clowns who trained wild boars, and the magicians and their tricks.\nIn his dazzling childhood memories, Gothson dimly saw his father walking into the reveling crowds, passing through an archway marked with the words \"Pile 'Em Up Contest,\" and slowly moving further away from him. But his attention was drawn to the shining fairy of the spring.\nPerhaps he came to understand in his later years that the spirit at the festival was no more than an actor paid 20 Mora a day, but in his young mind, that sight was always one full of fantastical imagination.\nGothson was lulled to sleep by the spring fairy's stories, and far abroad did he wander and adventure in his boundless dreams. In an adventurer's dream, he saw rainbow jam pour forth from the mouth of an ancient relief. Gothson was about to step up and partake of it, when his dream was shattered by the sounds of a fracas.\n\"Run!\" His father's panicked, pudgy face, smeared all over with fruit juice and meat sauce, dominated his vision.\nOver his shoulder, Gothson could see a towering stack of roasted meat under a glowing red light, tottering and trembling as it bent his way amid the horrified cries of the crowd.\n\nIn his flight, Gothson's father knocked a fat lady over, and threw his own hip. At once he fell, his full weight collapsing upon his son. Then, the leaning tower of roasted meat collapsed to echoing screams...\nThe Knights of Favonius took three days to finally clear up the roast meat, vegetables, food items, and other odds and ends that had been scattered all around the square — not to mention carry off those who had gotten a little too out of their gourds. From then on, they were forced to declare all future Ludi Harpastums would have to be held outside the city.\nThus did Gothson's house lose two hunters and gain two sick people in the space of one night. What did they get for it? A gold-plated champion's medal — two days late, to boot.\n",
        "37": "—Mondstadt Chapter—\nTeyvat Geographic Special Edition — Alice's Mondstadt Diaries\n\nDadaupa Gorge\n\nThe three hilichurl tribes located in this valley are all densely populated. What if we built a huge spinning, ball-shaped cell in the center of the valley and threw all of the hilichurls into it? That way we might be able to generate enough energy to power all the mills in Mondstadt for at least five years. If we took it one step further by grinding the hilichurls that are too old or too weak into food and feeding them to the strong ones, we might just build ourselves a perpetual motion machine that can support a huge factory like in Snezhnaya!\nIt seems totally feasible to me.\nBut when I told Miss Lisa about this idea, she just looked at me and pondered in silence for a long time, then changed the subject gracefully.\n\nStarsnatch Cliff\n\nThe Anemo Archon is a bit too undisciplined for me. If I were a god, I would not have allowed my realm to look so unorganized and ragged. With enough bombs placed in proper positions, even huge cliffs like Starsnatch would crumble into dust in a second. With flatter terrain, Mondstadt would surely look much nicer.\nBut that unctuous Cavalry Captain rejected my proposal instantly. He even asked me to stay away from Starsnatch Cliff.\n\nWindrise\n\nAt the center there is a huge oak tree. It is said that Vennessa ascended there. I searched around the tree for a long time but did not find any launching device.\nI grabbed some hilichurls nearby to put my theory to the test. Sadly, the longest flying distance was from here to the hunters' huts around Springvale. How disappointing.\n\nFalcon Coast\n\nMy unsuccessful experiment caused quite a stir in Springvale, so Miss Jean from the Knights of Favonius arranged someone to keep tabs on me. All I could do all day was wander around at Falcon Coast. This is such a boring place. Those stupid eagles hovering in the sky and puffed-up Anemo Slimes all bored me to death! The worst of all was that I had nothing to do!\nOn the other hand, the Outrider girl who was sent to monitor me had quite a lot of fun with the kids.\n\nWhispering Woods\n\nYet another forest in Mondstadt. This Outrider named Amber seemed to know her way around this place. The explosive toy she carried around caught my attention. With some tweaks, I could turn it into something that could blow this forest and even the nearby mountains into smithereens easily.\nMy proposal seemed to scare her. But an explosive stuffed toy is indeed a brilliant idea.\nI must try it out next time.\n\nBrightcrown Canyon\n\nI finally got rid of that stalker from the Knights of Favonius. This valley I found at the northeast coast of Cider Lake is still guarded by ancient mechanisms, but the soldiers responsible for holding the pass for the King of Gales were nowhere to be found now. All the winds of time had left behind were the unintelligent hilichurls and silent mechanical guards.\nMy attempt to control Ruin Guards with hilichurls failed as well. The guard split into pieces, and as for the fate of the hilichurl strapped onto it... I will spare you the gory details. Half of the ruins were also destroyed in the process.\n\nStormterror's Lair\n\nBrightcrown Canyon leads to this huge ruin of an ancient city which was built by the cruel King of Gales, Decarabian. The city was built in a ring shape. It seems that every resident of the city had been arranged their own spot between the inner and outer rings. Right in the center of the city was the tall tower where the King of Gales resided.\nThe ruins of the domain of this cruel king, who once tried to control his people's lives, are now utterly deserted.\nI blew up a few arcades so people can climb up the tower more easily. Looks quite good to me. The ruin feels more ancient now.",
        "38": "—Qingce Village—\nLeaving Dragonspine, I waded through rivers, walked across shoals carpeted with silver grass, and made my way through sun-dappled bamboo forests, before finally arriving at Mt. Qingce. My shoes and clothes were all soaked from the heavy rain. Luckily, the elders in the village were kind enough to let me hang my clothes in the assembly hall. They even prepared dry clothes and some food for me.\nThere were many children in Qingce Village. Sweet as they may be, they can become quite clingy. There were also many elders here. People living here seemed happy and carefree. The elders said that most of the young people had gone to work in Liyue Harbor. Many of them already had a family there and they would send money back every month. Having seen the prosperity and convenience of the city, it's hard for these young people to go back to the rural life here. Liyue Harbor has brought peace and prosperity to Qingce Village for the time being, but eventually it will also be the cause of its demise.\nLegend has it that the word \"Qingce\" originated from the name of an ancient monster \"Chi.\" \"Chi,\" of course, is what we call it now in the contemporary language. But in ancient times, the people of Liyue pronounced it as \"Qingce.\"\nAn elder said that thousands of years ago, Morax defeated the sea serpent and brought peace back to Liyue. After Chi died, its body turned to stone, its blood became water, and its scales are now the terraced fields. The monster's nest became what we now call Mt. Qingce.\nBut after a quick look, I believe the mountains consist of mostly rocks shattered by impacts from the outside. No traces of a hydro monster can be found in the rocks. Perhaps the corpse of Chi is long gone and this monster-turning-into-a-mountain thing is nothing but an ancient tale?\nMy next destination is the lake located amongst the stone peaks of Jueyun Karst. It is said that there is a labyrinth where the adepti live. Let's see if I can find them.",
        "39": "—Luhua Pool—\nTraveling southeast along the Bishui River, I came across a pond at the foot of Mt. Tianheng on the north side. The water is clearer than the sky and the water temperature is similar to a human's body temperature. The water has a sweet aftertaste.\n\nA local herb gatherer told me that thousands of years ago, this pond was once a garden. It is said that during the era of the Archon War, two lovers, whose families disapproved of their relationship, made this place their rendezvous. However, the times were merciless, and the man left his lover to follow the Geo Archon. He plunged himself bravely into the conflict as a mortal among gods... and like so many mortals in those dark days, none heard from him again for centuries.\n\nThe girl wandered the garden, awaiting the return of her lover. The flowers withered and grass grew in their place. Soaked in a flood, the grass rotted. And when the flood too had subsided, and to dust she had returned, her tears then converged into this pond. Perhaps it was her deep longing that made the water here so clear and gentle.\nI spent an afternoon here and nodded off while taking a bath in the pond. When I woke up, the stars were already glittering in the night sky.\n\nI noticed a baby fox slinking around me, but it got scared and ran away when I looked up.\n\nNot until later did I realize that one of my shoes was missing and my bag of provisions had been ransacked.\n\nIt took longer than I expected to pack my luggage.

No, not at all, I don't like her at all!\" Sachi looked away, worried that the old sage might discern his true feelings.\nHe reached for a box full of photo frames. He grabbed a few at random, each picture depicting a different beauty.\n\"Look at them... They all said that they gave me their one and only true love, but did they? In reality, I was just one of their many lovers.\"\nSachi did not know when or where he had heard the saying, but it blurted out from his mouth in his moment of annoyance:\n\"With so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance?\"",
        "40": "—Yaoguang Shoal—\nThis is the delta of the Bishui River, where the sand and mud carried by the river has accumulated into an open and flat shoal. When I finally arrived, the shoal was shrouded in a blanket of fog, and my new shoes were soaked again. I heard the sound of some unknown monsters coming from the fog, but couldn't quite tell their exact location.\nAll that was left to do was set up the tent and wait for this blasted fog to drift away.\nWhen I was staying at the Wangshu Inn, a merchant told me about the legends of Yaoguang Shoal. He started with a poem — \"Jade-lustered waves washed into the ocean while a conch lay empty on the white shoal.\"\nThe meaning of the poem is that the sunlight, pure as jade, glimmers on the surface of the Bishui River and seems to flow into the sea along with the river water. But the Greenconch Lodge on the Yaoguang Shoal has been unoccupied for some time.\nI once ventured into the fog to visit the Seashell Sanctuary, but didn't see the owner.\nA legend among fishermen has it that the Greenconch Lodge was the home of an adeptus — the green conch itself, in fact, constituting part of her very being. She provided shelter for travelers who were lost in the fog, took care of the shipwrecked survivors, and bid godspeed to other adepti on crusades against sea monsters.\nBut older fishermen interpret the legend differently. They say that the Seashell Sanctuary was not the abode of an adeptus, but of a family that had lived in the giant seashell for generations. They devoted themselves to helping the lost and saved many fishermen's lives.\nIt seems the fog is drifting away and the sun is almost visible now.\nNext up, I'll borrow a boat to get to Guyun Stone Forest and visit the ruins where the Geo Archon vanquished the sea monster.\nI should arrive in no time at all if the weather is good.",

I do hope you're going to bed on time and not causing any trouble for grandma and grandpa. I'll be back from Inazuma very soon, and I promise when I get back I'll take you to see The Crux's ship down at the harbor. I won't let you down this time!\n\nDongdong, do you remember the beach at Yaoguang Shoal? Well I went there, and I collected lots and lots of beautiful, golden sand. More than I can carry by myself. When I'm back, we should buy up the local mill and make fresh tofu every single day. Although, I'd rather use all this gold to buy a house in Liyue Harbor. A huge house with a splendid sea view. I'll let you decide how to spend it when I'm back. How does that sound?\n\nGuess what? Just opposite Luhua Pool at the Guili Plains there's an enormous cliff, and what did I find there? A Ruin Guard! He was just sitting there, slumped over, completely still. He didn't flinch even in the thunder and lightning, not even when the rain was pelting down on him. Then I realized, he must be sleeping! So I climbed up on top of him, threw my arms around that big old head of his, and twisted it as hard as I could. There was a clunking noise, followed by a loud boom, and suddenly his head fell off and rolled straight off the cliff! It smashed into a million pieces at the bottom. Shame really, otherwise I would have brought it home as a trophy, and you could have had a proper up-close look at what a Ruin Guard's head looks like. Imagine that!\n\nI also went to Jueyun Karst. I must take you there when you're older. The scenery there is incredible. The billowing clouds look like an ocean, the waterfall is infinitely better than the one in Qingce Village, and you can sometimes catch a glimpse of the realm of the adepti in the mountains. You can't begin to imagine how beautiful it was. And guess what? You're not going to believe this but... I met an actual, real-life adeptus! We sat and drank together, chatting and laughing away... The adeptus gave me a gift, too: a magic wine bottle. All you need to do is blow on it, and an infinite supply of wine will flow from the inside! You absolutely mustn't touch it though, do you understand? You're way too young to drink.

Until then, Dongdong, please make sure you go to bed on time every night. And don't eat too many sweets, they'll rot your teeth. Please also be nice to your grandma and grandpa — seriously, don't do anything to make them mad. And no fighting! I will be home soon.\n\nLots of love, Daddy x",
        "4": "When our perceptions are unfettered by archons and churches, we shall learn that in northern Teyvat, the people of Mondstadt preserved their culture as decades ago, even after Barbatos the Anemo Archon concealed himself. When we observe the daily lives of the people of Mondstadt from a higher perspective, it is evident that the people share a carefree nature, which mostly stems from their bountiful and pleasant living conditions. The surplus grain produced became their source of brews, and the brews further nourished their easygoing temperament. Above all, the Anemo Archon never taught them how to make wine and revel — they discovered it themselves.\nBut I do not intend to make my readers think that we could do without archons. On the contrary, say, if Barbatos had not guided the warm monsoons to Mondstadt with his divine powers, would Mondstadt still be so bountiful as to produce the brews that it does?\nThe answer would be no. Mondstadt is an inland city and would have struggled to provide for itself if not for the grace of Barbatos. If we look back through history, we learn that Mondstadt is situated on a land that was once frozen, where the living conditions were harsh and brewing would be virtually impossible. It was the power of Barbatos that changed everything.\nA cumbersome preface indeed, but I hope that my readers keep one thing in mind when reading my humble book: while it is the power of archons that created our living environment, we should be conscious of the fact that what shapes our thinking, logic, culture, philosophy and aesthetics is not the archons themselves, but the objective environment that exists around us. This world around us is what we have inherited, and what this book shows is that the people of Teyvat have always been, and always will be, heirs to a divine legacy — but not to divinity itself.",

I should have known not to trust this old mining crew, it must have been several decades since the last of them retired! Every last bit of information they gave me is completely out of date... utterly useless. This is turning into a complete farce. I would say I'll be going home empty-handed tonight, but the chances of me finding my way home at all in this fog are looking slim... I hope Dongdong's eaten dinner.\n\nI can hear hilichurls somewhere in the distance. I have no idea where I'm going in this fog, so I suppose I'll just focus on walking away from the hilichurls' voices. Hopefully I'll make it out alive...\n\nI don't know how long I've been walking, and in this fog I don't even know if it's daytime or nighttime. Hang on, are those silhouettes I see up ahead? By the good grace of the Geo Lord, maybe I can join along with them and find a way out of here. Yep, that's what I'm gonna do. Hooray, I'm saved!\n\nOn closer inspection, the silhouettes didn't look like friendly characters. I've decided to set up a camp here and wait for them to leave before figuring out my next move. I might have to go back the way I came.\n\nEgads! I can hear hilichurls all around me... I should definitely—\n\n-End of diary content-",
        "51": "—Guili Plains—\nWhat a string of bad luck...\n\nI finally made it out of that hilichurl camp alive, only to end up nearly being killed by a Ruin Guard! I'd figured it was probably out of action given the way it was sat there completely motionless in the torrential rain. But then a bolt of lightning struck it right on the head... There was some whirring and grinding, and suddenly it was back to life.\n\nI was powerless to defend myself against it. It lifted me up like a baby bird and tossed me from the top of the cliff. Luckily, amidst my frantic scrambling, I managed to duck into a cave at the foot of the cliff. It was out of his line of sight, so it gave up trying to find me. If not for that cave, it'd have ripped me to shreds, thrown me to the ground, and then stomped me into... I don't even know what you'd call it by that point!\n\nSurely it must be well away from here by now... Even so, I can still hear the droning noise it made, like a swarm of bees buzzing around inside my head. I think I must have broken my arm, because it hurts when I put any pressure on it. I think — I hope — that I will be able to manage, though. In any case, at my age I need to grin and bear it. I mean, what would Dongdong and his mother think of me if I didn't?",
        "52": "—Jueyun Karst—\nNear the foot of the cliff, I ran into a herb gatherer who helped me set the bone. I almost passed out from the pain. But he did say that most passers-by he meets who have survived an encounter with a Ruin Guard tend to be less physically intact than I am... Every cloud has a silver lining, I guess.\n\nFrom above, Jueyun Karst looks completely untouched by human activity. It's also shrouded in mist, and to add to the mystery it's impossible to know just how deep the mist goes. Strange noises can be heard coming from the stone forest. Whether it's illuminated beasts or celestial beings in there, I don't know. All I know is it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. With any luck I should be able to pick up a quality chunk of amber here, or maybe some highly prized medicinal herbs. I know that back in the day many of the poorer village folks made their fortunes and built their lives in Liyue by selling herbal medicine, and I see no reason why I couldn't do the same.\n\nIt rained heavily in the evening, which meant the cliff face was too slippery to climb up. I also couldn't find my climbing rope or axe anywhere. It's strange, I'm not the type to lose things so easily... I'll bet one of the monsters lurking in the mountains pinched it when I wasn't looking! Maybe it was a fox...\n\nAfter several days of fruitless searching, I finally found some good medicinal herbs so I'm getting ready to head back. I had wanted to do one final search, but this place is starting to creep me out. As soon as night falls I keep thinking I see shadowy figures following me everywhere... Also, the blood-curdling cries of some unknown species of monster are now coming from all directions — and they're getting closer...\n\nDuring my descent down the mountain, I came across an old wine bottle. I gave it a rinse with some spring water, and found it's in good condition. I bet Dongdong would like it if I gave it to him as a souvenir. I'll just tell him that it was a treasure given to me by an adeptus.",
        "53": "—Liyue Harbor—\nI sold the herbs at Bubu Pharmacy. Made back everything I've lost, plus a little extra. At this rate, I could buy a house in Liyue within the next few years.

I also wouldn't have squandered the inheritance my father left me. This makes me think that I must get Dongdong a good teacher who makes him study hard. That's the only way he'll make reliable friends and not end up like his wretched old man. So, for Dongdong's sake, I can't give up now. I have got to find a way to make a good living.\n\n...That said, I couldn't get the idea of making a quick fortune out of my head. So I tried my luck at The Jade Mystery. I hadn't intended to spend any money at a place like that, but the boss, Shitou, was very persuasive... He talked me into putting all my money into it. I didn't do too badly. I cut open the stone I bought and found it to be higher-quality jade. Then again, that one brief foray into the world of gambling on stones meant that I had to pawn the sickle and the medicine box I'd used for foraging for herbs.\n\nI'm penniless now. Sure, I got some good jade pieces from gambling on stones, but jade isn't easy to shift. So it looks like I'm back in survival mode again. I think I'll head overseas and see how it goes.

Six giant Stone Pillars kept the sun out of my eyes as I went ashore, and it was remarkably cool in their shade. The crabs on the beach were big and meaty. Maybe it's because the area has been nourished by the remains of a magical beast for millennia? Anyway, they taste great roasted.\n\nThe sheer beauty of this place makes it hard to imagine that it was once the site of a bloody battle between the Geo Archon and the sea monster. Suffice to say the blood once shed here has long since vanished into the sea without a trace. I suppose that everything pales into insignificance when faced with the scale of the sea. Whether it's a single drop of an ordinary person's blood or rivers of blood shed collectively by the heroes of the past, the relentless flowing of the winds and waves are destined to wash every last trace of it away. In the end, everything will be just as it has always been, since time immemorial.\n\nLegend has it that the Geo Archon once carved a giant polearm out of the rocky land. He plunged it deep into the ocean, riding it straight through the body of the demon that wrought chaos upon his domain. Over the years, the wind gradually eroded the stone polearm into the form we see today.\n\nLater, I'll return to the mainland to camp out for the night. From where I am, I can see the ships leaving the harbor in the distance. As I write, The Crux is setting sail once more, embarking on its next grand voyage. I wonder what mission the Qixing Commerce Guild has entrusted to the legendary Captain Beidou this time?\n\nI had the most awful night's sleep last night. I dreamt I was somewhere pitch-black and damp. Suddenly, I was a sea monster, and my impaled body was being driven into the ocean floor by the Geo Archon's polearm. I writhed around and clutched at the giant polearm made of rock, trying desperately to free myself, but it was wedged firmly in place. Each movement I made filled me with agony, and with rage...\n\nNote to self: Guyun Stone Forest is not a good place to spend the night! I woke early, so I lit the campfire and I'll move out once the sky's bright. My next stop is Liyue Harbor: I just need to be somewhere that I can get my clothes washed, beard trimmed, that sort of thing. Once I've sorted myself out, I'm making another trip to Jueyun Karst. I didn't make any progress on finding the adepti last time. This time, I think I'll try my luck at Qingyun Peak.\n\nAnother note to self: Do not lose my diary again!",
        "55": "—Sal Terrae—\nMy shoes are completely waterlogged after trekking here from the banks of Dihua Marsh. The last time I took them off to pour the water out, a frog jumped out.\n\nFrom the scale of this ruin, I suspect it is the temple that provided safe refuge for civilians during the Archon War several millennia ago. I've heard that the God of Salt built such a place. Liyue folklore holds that she was the gentlest of the gods. In the brutality and chaos of wartime, human beings were puny and disposable. But the Salt God refused to join the other gods in their senseless battle for dominance, instead choosing to give shelter to those dispossessed by the war. She brought them here to build a new settlement. She showed them kindness and comfort. And even as global upheaval ushered in the end of an epoch, she worked tirelessly to bring about a return to peace between the gods.\n\nIt seems that most parts of the ancient city have sunk into the riverbed of Bishui River. It's fortunate that the foundation of the temple is still here after all this time.\n\nShe amassed a group of followers who settled in the area now known as Sal Terrae and lived a humble existence. The city stood for several centuries, finally falling with the downfall of the god herself.\n\nThe gentlest of the gods fell not in battle at the hand of the other gods. She fell at the hand of one of her own people, the people she had loved so dearly.\n\nHe was the first king of the people, and also the last. He had once loved the God of Salt just as the rest did, but as a mere mortal, he ultimately could not fathom the self-sacrificial love the god embodied. He sought after military might, in the hope that the city might be able to hold its own in defense and attack. And so, to demonstrate that gentleness was a virtue unfit for the times, he took a sword and ended the life of the lone, defenseless god. No sooner had she met her demise than the temple itself collapsed, and the people's city crumbled like salt into the earth.\n\nAs for the treacherous king's fate, theories abound but none are certain. Some say he continued to reign in solitude from the ruins for centuries, finally turning to dust long after the cries of war had subsided, the ruins had been engulfed by the river, and insects had hollowed out his scepter. Other say that he took his own life after taking that of the god, unable to bear the guilt of deicide that weighed upon his conscience. In any case, the people on whom the Salt God had once looked so fondly became scattered across Liyue. In the safe haven of Liyue Harbor, under the rule of the Geo Archon, they and their stories survived, and that is why we still hear about them to this day.\n\nRumors say that the Salt God's body can still be found somewhere in the depths of the ruins. Though her body has turned to salt, it still maintains her posture from the moment she was struck by the king's sword.\n\nIt looks like we're in for some heavy rain: dark clouds are gathering as far as the eye can see. I'd better get moving. I'm going to head northwest to Mt. Qingce. Hopefully I can make it there before the rain gets too heavy. And hopefully it's not such a mad dash that I lose my diary en route...",
        "56": "—Qingyun Peak, Jueyun Karst—\nI shall preface my adventurer's diary with a stern reminder to myself. Recently, I keep discovering that I've misplaced my diary every time I feel like I want to write in it. Oh, Roald, you must learn to be more careful in future!\n\nAfter climbing for what feels like an eternity, I have finally reached the top of the precipice. I'm surrounded by a sea of clouds. It's impossible to know where in the midst of that sea of clouds I once stood looking up at this celestial place where the adepti dwell.\n\nApart from the few oddly-shaped trees, there are barely any signs of life here at the top of the precipice. Occasionally, a Lapis Glede will let out a high-pitched cry before diving down into the clouds and disappearing from view. Up the hill from here is the adeptus's dwelling, but there's a few things I need to sort out before I head up. The most pressing issue is repairing my climbing gear, I'll also tend to a few cuts and grazes while I'm at it. A kind farmer gave me some ointment when I first arrived in Jueyun Karst — it stings, but it really does work.\n\nNights atop the precipice offer little in the way of comfort. The relentless wind above the clouds pierces to the bone. It's difficult to shelter oneself from it, because it finds its way to you through all the tiny gaps in the tent, and there's no way you could keep a campfire alight in this wind. A good night's sleep is therefore out of the question. I wonder if the adeptus who dwells at the summit ever gets lonely and dispirited being surrounded by nothing but the cold, heartless wind?\n\nAt the end of a long and sleepless night, I finally watched the moon set into the sea of clouds. I'll make sure my pack is securely fastened, then at daybreak I'll begin my journey to the summit where the adeptus dwells. Hopefully, the altitude is high enough that it won't rain.",
        "57": "—Aozang Lake, Jueyun Karst—\nI seem to have lost yet another diary... I don't understand, I even made sure to say to myself three times: \"Whatever you do, don't lose your diary.\" But then I got caught up in my adventure, and it went straight out of my head. I waste so much paper every year... I do hope the Dendro Archon won't mind.\n\nI have arrived at a mountain lake located high on Mt. Aocang. To get here, I had to hike up a winding dirt trail, make my way across perilous wooden walkways built by herb gatherers in ancient times, and then scale a steep, wet cliff. I was told by some fishermen that the lake is a thousand furlongs deep, but after taking a dip in the water I can safely say that their statements were pure hyperbole.\n\nThe Qingce Village elders were right after all: the mountain lake's water is sweet and warm. This place certainly lives up to its reputation as a celestial paradise! Back when I had just arrived in Jueyun Karst, an old farmer told me that the adepti possess a mysterious magical ability that lets them turn into mist and roam in the sea of clouds. I dismissed it as an old wives' tale at the time, but seeing the way the mist over the lake rises up to the summit and merges together with the sea of clouds, it does make me wonder... The adeptus I've been searching for could be roaming the clouds at the summit right now, for all I know, and I would be completely oblivious to it.\n\nI headed east down Mt. Aocang and ended up thoroughly lost in a thick forest. Finally, I came to a clearing and discovered I was back at the banks of the Bishui River. I have an excellent view of the surrounding area here, so I think this is where I'll camp for the night.\n\nWhile I was sorting through my things at the camp, I met a young lady who looked like she was out on a treasure hunt. She was called Eduarda, and she explained that she was heading west to look for a \"Miraculous Lake\" at the foot of Mt. Aocang:\n\n\"Legends tell of an adeptus who lives beside a lake at the foot of Mt. Aocang on the northern side. If that's true, then that's sure to be where the adeptus keeps their secret treasure, too... Mwuhahaha, I know exactly what I'll do when I get my hands on that treasure!\"\n\nThen she quickly changed her tune, as if suddenly realizing how she sounded: \"I... I'd contact the Guild, and report to them if I found it! I am a proud member of the Adventurers' Guild, and I have absolutely no connection to the Treasure Hoarders!\"\n\nIndeed, some adventurers are in the business for material wealth alone. I'm reminded of that classic Liyue saying, \"To each their unfathomable own\"... But whatever her motivations, she is a fellow adventurer nonetheless, and a genuine one at that.\n\nI must say, I was tempted to head west in search of this fabled \"Miraculous Lake\" myself after hearing Eduardo talk about it. But in the end I decided to stick with my existing plan. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I will proceed to the Guili Plains to see what sights and treasures are waiting to be discovered there. And hopefully I won't lose my diary again this time — again, barring any unforeseen circumstances. I can't lose another one... May any unforeseen circumstances be well and truly barred.",
        "58": "—Liyue Chapter—\nTeyvat Geographic Special Edition - Alice's Travels in Liyue\n\nDihua Marsh\n\nThe northern stretch of the Bishui River turns into a wetland. If you look south beyond the Stone Gate you will see a Silvergrass marsh as far as the eye can see. At the southernmost point of the marsh is an inn perched atop a giant rock. That is the Wangshu Inn, the highest point on the entire marsh. Look south from there and you will see the Guili Plains. You can also make out the Guyun Stone Forest across the sea. Also — there's a weirdo staying at the inn on the top floor. I don't think I've ever heard him say a single word.\nLunch is a true feast at the Wangshu Inn. The kitchen is equipped with every utensil you could imagine — perfect for getting some practical alchemy experience.\nOn the topic of alchemy practice, I've got a few new things to test out in my search for an explosion catalyst. If everything goes smoothly, I'll spend a few more days here then head to the Guili Plains.\n\nGuili Plains\n\nIn the end, I came to the Guili Plains a few days earlier than I'd originally planned.\nRecords suggest that prior to the Archon War, this area was a thriving marketplace.\nThe foxes and wild finches are stunning here, with fur and feathers that have a certain glow about them. But I hear that they can be pests, too. Liyue locals complain that they keep eating their fruit offerings to the Geo Archon. I wonder if that gives them a fruity aroma when roasted? Maybe I should go hunting.\nThey run a strict operation at the checkpoint on the main road, but the guards who work there are friendly people. I made a potion from some local herbs and gave it to one of them for his stutter — it cured him, but it did have some minor side effects. He now can't help but constantly imitate everyone he comes across. Not just what they say, but the way they say it. It's uncanny how spot-on his impressions are.\n\nJueyun Karst\n\nI'm told that somewhere amidst the misty peaks of Jueyun Karst lives an adeptus, the exact location hidden somewhere in the ocean of cloud. All the Liyue herb gatherers claim to have seen the realm of the adepti in all its glory revealed before their very eyes in the clouds. Based on personal experience, I can say that over-indulging on certain types of mushrooms can induce visions of a similar nature.\nThe terrain here fascinates me. So many of these Stone Pillars look like they belong deep underground, not here on top of a mountain. There is supposed to be an underground reservoir here. Part of me wonders if all the water was drawn out, perhaps Jueyun Karst would find itself back on the ocean floor where it belongs.\nMy travel companion Zhongli is the sternest person I know, but he seems most entertained by this theory. He won't stop laughing.\nWhat an odd fellow.\n\nYaoguang Shoal\n\nI've heard that the fog often rolls in off the sea onto Yaoguang Shoal, and when it's at its thickest you can barely see your hand at the end of your outstretched arm. Unfortunately, I didn't make it here in time to see a foggy episode. It's a bit of a shame.\nThere are so many lovely shells on the beach. I wonder how many of them have been there since the Archon War? I strung some of them together to make a necklace, but unfortunately that fisherman from the inn sat on it and broke it... Every last shell, brutally crushed beneath his merciless buttocks. None were spared.\nNot only that, but because he injured himself on the shards of broken shell, I had to pay his medical bills.\nA giant conch shell stands on the beach where the Bishui River enters the sea. A kind old lady lives inside. Her family is said to have sailed here on the giant shell, and she spends her time rescuing shipwrecked people who end up drifting near the shore. I think that repurposing the giant shell as a self-propelled boat would make it much easier for her to rescue people from the sea.\nBut after I lost control of my third prototype seashell-boat and it blew up, the kind old lady decided she was not going to rescue me from the sea anymore.\n\nGuyun Stone Forest\n\nThis is the site where the Geo Archon defeated the sea monster. Some of the great stone spears that pierce the ocean floor still tower above the surface of the sea, though many snapped long ago. The hexagonal Stone Pillars, formed from a conglomeration of Geo energy, are quite intriguing to look at. Viewed from above, one gets the impression that they were deliberately arranged in their current form to make a specific shape on the ocean surface. Maybe that was the real reason the Geo Archon rained down destruction on the ocean floor with his stone spears? Maybe it was all just a big joke, albeit in extremely poor taste?\nZhongli from Liyue Harbor seems extremely knowledgeable on Liyue folklore, but I've never actually seen him come here. I can see the Wangshu Inn in the distance. I'll bet that weirdo I met there last time is still staring this way now.\nThe flow of the ley lines around here is unique in all of Liyue. Much more dynamic, somewhat unstable... It's as if a great, relentless power stirs somewhere in the depths of the ocean. Perhaps it is the defeated sea monster, still writhing on the ocean floor.",

        "72": "—Stone Beasts—\nStone statues appear all across the vast land of Liyue. Most were built by locals who prayed to them for favorable weather and peace steadfast as the mountains. But it is claimed that some have a much more ancient history.\nOne story regarding the animal statues in particular is popular among the fishermen of the Bishui River, the Silvergrass harvesters of Dihua Marsh, and the old mining crowd. They say that in some corners of the land, ancient stone beasts wake at night in the cool of the fall and look around at a world that has slowly become alien to them. Hearing the sounds of frogs and insects greeting them, they respond with deep, soulful cries from their petrified throats. Then they roam around Liyue, inspecting once more the land they used to protect.\nTo my knowledge, no-one has ever witnessed a stone beast in motion firsthand. However, local residents who know the territory extremely well have long observed and accepted the phenomenon that the animal statues can change location and posture overnight. Meanwhile, light-sleeping campers often report hearing a sound in the middle of the night that is like flowing water, only much deeper in tone.\nAs for where these stone beasts originally came from, the elders of Qingce Village say they are illuminated beasts who once fought alongside Rex Lapis in the Archon War. After the war ended, the tide subsided and peace was restored. The illuminated beasts were no longer required to serve as defenders of the common people, and one by one they retreated to more secluded parts of the country. There they lived free from concern for mortal affairs.\nBut some illuminated beasts remembered with fondness the glorious days when they served under Rex Lapis, and they pined for the years they protected Liyue. Though they were not of the mortal realm, nor were they immortal: For them, too, life would one day come to an end. Thus, they beseeched Rex Lapis to turn their ephemeral flesh bodies into everlasting stone. The merciful Geo Archon granted their request and made them as such.",
        "73": "—Palace Beneath the Sea—\nThe day had arrived. It was time to collect the bride.\nThe Sea God looked majestic indeed as he sat center stage in his giant clam, holding in his hands the reins of two sea serpents. They stood as imposing as Mt. Tianheng before the royal carriage as their master accepted the gift of pearls from the village elders and welcomed his new bride aboard the carriage. In return, the village would receive the Sea God's blessing: a year free from tempests and tsunamis.\n\nThe bride was whisked away to a place deep beneath the waves, far from home, far from the reveling crowds celebrating the festival, and far from her mother all alone. The Sea God took her along a corridor of great columns, formed from the skeleton of a dead whale, that led to a palatial gate adorned with shining pearls and iridescent shells. Finally, the young bride had arrived at the palace the Sea God had made for her. The palace that was to be her new home.\n\"It was not my plan to meddle in the affairs of common people,\" came the god's voice rippling through the water. It was a husband's attempt to console his bride.\n\"This place has served as a new home for many other young women, and it also became the place they spent their final days. Many of them were driven away from the village where they were born. For them, the ocean has provided safe refuge. Somewhere they could sleep peacefully without fear of being disturbed. Somewhere they could call home.\"\n\nBut this young woman did not want a new home decorated with prize pearls and rare shells. The dazzling spectacle of the ocean floor — and the creatures that she knew lurked in the darkness — filled her not with peace, but with dread. Time went by, and the longer she stayed in her bewildering ocean chamber that knew not sunrise nor sunset, the more homesick she grew — and the frailer she became.\nEventually, there came a day when the Sea God sensed what his young bride was feeling. Though he was saddened by her choice, he allowed her to go through with her decision.\n\"In the fallen world of the humans, there will come a day in your life when you regret this decision.\" The Sea God took the shell of a sea snail that adorned his waist and handed it to her as a parting gift.\n\"There will come a day that you blow into this shell, and it will sound like a horn. On that day, you shall return to this place.\"\n\nThe young woman took the shell and returned to the land. The years went by, and soon she became a mother herself. As she went about her simple, peaceful life, the ocean palace seemed but a childhood dream. The dazzling sights and grotesque creatures would once in a while flood into her mind from the murky depths of her memory, but it was a rare occurrence, and she put them out of her mind. She lived like this year after year. Until one year, when the festival came once again, the village elders came to her home. They had come to take her daughter from her arms. It was then that she finally understood why the Sea God had spoken of her regret, and of her return, all those years ago.\nOn the eve of the festival, she blew into the shell, and it sounded like a horn.\nThe Sea God responded to the call, rising up from the billowing waves to greet the village. But his embrace was a tidal wave that engulfed the village, and took the villagers and elders in their sleep. Drawn by giant sea serpents, a colossal clam carriage came to a halt in front of her, dazzling her with its shimmering pearls.\nThe mother took her daughter by the hand and boarded the Sea God's clam.

Myths and legends abound among the herb gatherers, telling of adepti and evil spirits.\nOnce, there was a herb seller named Qiangu who went to Jueyun Karst to investigate the distribution of medicinal herbs there. Unbeknownst to him, a group of brigands had followed him into the mountains. They waited for cover of night, and when he let his guard down they struck. He was knocked unconscious. The brigands grabbed his possessions, bound him from head to foot, and left him alone in the valley.\nDeep in the night, the herb seller finally awoke. He struggled against the ropes that bound him, and cried out for help. But the vast mountains did not respond. The only sounds to be heard in the thick mountain forest, save for the echoes of his own pitiful wails, were the faint cries of the birds disturbed by them.\nQiangu sank into despair and sighed with sorrow. Just when he thought all hope was lost, a deep voice came rumbling through the mountains, cutting through the cries of nocturnal birds and the whistling of the wind.\n\"Arise!\"\n\"I am unable to!\" The herb seller protested amidst floods of tears. His cry frightened off a fox that was prowling in the night. But as he tensed his body once more against the ropes that bound him, he discovered they had completely loosened.\nThe herb seller stood up. No sooner had he arisen than the disembodied voice, without pausing to hear the expression of gratitude that would be customary in such situations, spoke to him once more:\n\"Ascend!\"\nAs instructed, Qiangu ascended the mountain, following the winding dirt track to the summit as the horizon began to glow in the east. From the summit he saw a twisted and withered pine growing on a cliff, its branches sprawling outwards as if trying to escape into the air. The gentle creaking of the branches drew his attention to the ropes that hung from them — at the other end of which hung the brigands from the night before, bound in like fashion from head to foot.\nThen he saw the old man whose voice he had heard, his hair and beard as white as snow, sat atop a curiously shaped rock as if it were his throne. The old man took one look at Qiangu's disheveled appearance and grinned mischievously before returning his possessions to him intact.\nQiangu inquired as to the old man's origins, but he replied that he belonged to the mountains, his home being wherever he roamed and his bed being wherever he laid his head. Qiangu sought to thank the old man with all manner of courtesies and compensations, but he dismissed them all. After much deliberation, he took just a single Mora to one day give as a wedding gift to Qiangu's beloved daughter, in order that he might attend the wedding feast.\nOut of disaster seemed to spring forth good fortune, for following this incident Qiangu's store grew ever more popular, while word of the wealthy herb seller himself spread far and wide. Some say that after making his fortune, he returned to Jueyun Karst in search of the old man, but found nothing save for a few abandoned tents and empty wine bottles. Some claim to have spotted the old man at Yaoguang Shoal, disguised as a miner and darting around like the wind between the precipices. Others insist he is a fisherman who spends his time saving those who become stranded at sea. The stories are too many to count, and yet no-one knows the old man's name.\nLamentably, age and ill health have now ushered in the twilight years of Qiangu's life while his beloved daughter remains unmarried. Perhaps the day will still come that the old man from the mountain attends the wedding feast, but that day seems impossibly far in the future for Qiangu.",
        "76": "—Flower Ball—\nIt is customary at weddings in Liyue for the bride to cast a flower ball towards the oncoming crowd of guests. It is said that the one fortunate enough to catch it will enjoy a year of good luck: business owners will see their wealth increase, the poor will see their fortunes turn around, the single will encounter their fated partners, and the married will see their shared life blossom with mutual love and appreciation, never again to descend into petty squabbles over life's daily vexations.\nWhile some brides use a real flower ball, many alternatives exist depending on the family's wealth. The rich tend to use woven balls with silk from the Silk Flower, while the poor fashion theirs from colored paper or cloth. But the custom itself is observed in the same fashion at all of Liyue's weddings, even though the fortunes of individual families may differ.\nSome say the Liyue custom was originally adopted from the Ludi Harpastum festival celebrated in the neighboring Wind Kingdom of Mondstadt. Others say it dates back to before the Archon War when the Salt God roamed free in Liyue. She once stood shoulder to shoulder with the many gods of Liyue, but her extraordinarily gentle nature saw her quickly ousted in the hubris of the Archon War, before being ruthlessly murdered by one of her own followers.\nHer remains are likely to be found somewhere in the ruins of the area known as \"Sal Terrae.\" According to a legend that time has unfortunately stripped of all useful detail, she once handed out bunches of flowers to her people as a blessing to them. Or at least, if not a blessing, then a small gesture of comfort to stave off the bitterness of wartime existence. In any case, following her return to the elements, it is conceivable that her followers spread across Liyue, took this custom with them, and taught it to the locals. The people of Liyue being a competitive and fun-loving folk, they may then have adapted it and embellished upon it to suit their own preferences.\nDespite being a benign and joyful celebration at heart, security logs from the Millelith indicate that the throwing of flower balls is responsible for a significant number of injuries every year. In fact, the number of cases is more or less the same as those caused by monster attacks.",
        "77": "In the beginning, Rex Lapis descended. He lowered the tides, raised Mt. Tianheng, and calmed the waves. Thereupon, peace was brought to the people. They cut into the mountain and found jade, they bored through the rock and made tunnels, and they piled up stones and built a settlement. It is written that the jade from the bowels of the mountain is that which glows. Hence, they named it \"Shanhui Fort\"[1]. In that time, all the people of Tianheng derived their livelihood from the mines, all prospered from them, and none knew poverty within a thousand-mile radius.\n\n[1] Better known today as \"Shanhui Rock,\" which is often simplified to \"Mountain Rock,\" thereby stripping the name of most of its original meaning.\n\n...\n\nGuizhong, the Lord of Dust, was an ally to the Lord of Rock. Around Mt. Tianheng, Guizhong set up a Crossbow to keep guard, and it was named the \"Guizhong Ballista.\" She brought her people to the north of Mt. Tianheng and taught them to tend the soil. Agriculture became their livelihood, and all prospered from it. The farming towns stretched for miles, and it was said that one could walk all the way to Stone Gate without ever leaving the network of pathways between the fields. Guizhong said to the Lord of Rock: \"My people had left their home and came to this place. Here, they are happy in their abodes and content in their work, thus it is as if they have returned home. Hence, what better name to call this place than 'the Plains of Returning and Departing'?\" The Lord of Rock praised the Lord of Dust for her work, and thereafter the area was named in the tongue of Liyue \"Guili Plains.\"\n\n[2] It later came to pass that the gods each strove for dominance, which brought catastrophe upon the land. Though the adepti fought to protect the Guili Plains, they could not stop the tide of war, which ravaged the plains and took the life of its ruler, Guizhong. Thereupon, the Lord of Rock Rex Lapis took his people south of Mt. Tianheng. Thus the people departed from the Guili Plains for good, never to return, and it was left to become a wilderness.\n\n...\n\nRex Lapis pacified the gods, adepti and yakshas were content in their positions, and Liyue re-entered an era of peace. Before this time, the gods waged war for centuries on end, and not one field was left unravaged. The people of Liyue turned to commerce and artisanship for their livelihood, and prospered once more. Those who prospered above the rest joined together, calling themselves the Qixing. Thus was formed the framework around which Liyue Harbor developed. Under the jurisdiction of the Qixing were all the known trades. No business of Liyue took place inside or outside the nation that was not known unto them. The Millelith also took orders from the Qixing, supporting the masses at home and suppressing the monsters at the border. Thus became the nature of Liyue's governance under Rex Lapis.",

        "79": "Hilichurlian Social Structure\n\nThe social structure of the hilichurl race is evidently a primitive, tribal one. Small-sized hilichurl tribes are prolific in occurrence throughout the wilderness. It seems that they conceive of the tribe as akin to a large, extended family.\n\nBy far the most powerful figure in the hilichurl tribe is the Shaman. Extensive field research confirms that the Shaman is the oldest member of the tribe and plays a role in it analogous to that of the parent in the family: managing major affairs and making policy decisions, based on their wealth of experience. Additionally, Shamans act as protector to their tribe using their elemental abilities. Shamans can be identified by their distinctive appearance from other tribe members: They wear horned, smiling-face masks with eye holes at the mouth, and wield a rudimentary Shaman's staff in their hands. A further identifying feature is that they will be heard chanting to themselves some form of unintelligible hymn or incantation.\n\nAge is not always the deciding factor when it comes to status in the tribe. In some tribes, Shamans are ousted from leadership by physically larger hilichurls with superior combat skills. Under leadership of this kind, such tribes tend to become more aggressive. The chiefs of these tribes can easily be identified from their large stature and ostentatious masks, which also bear horns.\n\nThe hilichurls' hostility towards outsiders, coupled with the obvious language barriers, means that conducting specific research on the distribution of resources within tribes has been all but impossible. Nevertheless, Knights of Favonius' patrol reports suggest that resources are typically shared on the basis of \"to each according to his needs.\" All tribe members are both gatherers and soldiers, but some that prize combat above others develop into seasoned heavyweights of the battlefield. If the tribe stays long enough in an unfavorable environment, these heavyweights will become its most respected leaders.\n\nInterestingly, hilichurls seem to have a unique ability to manipulate the elements despite their low intelligence and primitive social structure. This ability is most notably manifested in the Shamans. Typically, humans require a Vision in order to exercise elemental control. The question of how hilichurls are able to do so without a Vision is, therefore, one that requires further investigation and analysis.",

        "80": "Hilichurl Spirituality\n\nJust as the inhabitants of the Seven Nations of Teyvat each have their religious beliefs, so too do the hilichurls. However, they worship not a specific figurehead with a presence in this world — such as one of The Seven — but elemental power itself in a more abstract sense. For instance, some hilichurl tribes in Mondstadt revere Anemo just as their human counterparts do, but they do not recognize the Anemo Archon Barbatos. Instead, they worship the power of Anemo itself. Hilichurls holding different elemental beliefs often live together in the same tribe. An individual hilichurl's elemental affiliation can be deduced from the designs on their masks and the color of their body paint.\n\nFirsthand observations indicate that the Shaman, responsible for organizing offerings and worship ceremonies for the tribe, applies a colored dye to their hair and skin, with the color representing the element they worship. Shamans are dressed and adorned more ornately than ordinary tribe members, but owing to the limited intelligence of the hilichurls it is highly doubtful that any of the fine ornaments worn are crafted by their own hand.\n\nThe Shaman is the spiritual leader of his tribe. He leads them in song and dance during worship, singing hymns of praise to the elements. If there is leftover meat from the hunt, the hilichurls place it on the altar, raw, as a sacrifice. Even though they accumulate ample Mora, precious stones, and other items of value through exploring, looting, mugging and other means, it would appear that raw meat alone is considered a sufficient sacrifice.\n\nIt would appear that the hilichurls possess no concept of either the past or future, living only in the present. They do not intentionally store up food for survival, nor do they commemorate their deceased forebears. Though crude attempts at something like calligraphy have been widely observed within their camps, closer inspection reveals these markings to be nothing more than botched imitations of what they have seen in ancient ruins, possessing no originality whatsoever. Hilichurls do seem to have an inexplicable affinity for remnants of the past, evidenced by the fact that ruins are one of their preferred locations to camp. But investigations thus far have turned up nothing which might hint at the true nature of their connection with the lost civilizations to which these ruins belong.",
        "81": "Dadaupa Gorge, Mondstadt: a Case for Cultural Diversity Among the Hilichurls\n\nThe Meaty tribe is fond of feasting. They have built a boar-rearing pen in the center of their settlement and assigned a swineherd to watch over it. Over a natural stove made with a Pyro Slime, they cook boar stew in a single, large pot from which each tribe member feeds according to their needs.\nThe most striking feature of this tribe is its sizable combat arena. Those who set foot in the arena are understood to be accepting an open invitation to engage in combat, and those subsequently ousted from it face being mocked by the entire tribe.\n\nThe Sleeper tribe is prone to sleeping at every opportunity. They have built themselves an environment especially conducive to sleep, consisting of simple, wooden huts furnished with soft animal hide for beds. They are the most cunning and devious of the hilichurl tribes, and their above-average mental capacity can perhaps be attributed to the superior sleep quality they enjoy.\n\nThe practices of the Eclipse tribe are the most occult of any in Mondstadt. They concern themselves neither with brains nor brawn, but with occult power. Distinct from the elemental powers worshiped by their peers, the object of their worship is a crude symbol that appears to represent an eclipsed sun. Their shamans are more powerful than those of the other tribes. In the center of their settlement, the other tribe members have built a grand throne for the most formidable of shamans who leads them.",
        "82": "During the time of the aristocracy, the tyrants who ruled Mondstadt spurned the study of history and forbade the people from speech and song that alluded to historical events. For they knew the extent of their own degeneracy, and wished not for their deeds to be held to scrutiny by the annals of history alongside tales of heroes' honor and glory.\n\nBut the winds of history blow strong, and ultimately no wall could be built tall enough to stay them. This work is a collection of all poems, songs, and legends that have survived from the aristocratic period, interspersed with archaeologists' commentary. Its purpose is to provide a new account of Mondstadt's history from the Age of Kings all the way through to the fall of the Aristocracy. A degree of historical inaccuracy is inevitable, given that certain details are impossible to verify. We can but humbly hope that this work might elucidate the past for those who come after us, or perhaps inspire them to further investigate the facts of history on their own.\n\nThis work is divided into three sections: Section 1, \"The Stormlord of the Tower and the Kingwolf of Boreas,\" covers the struggle between the Kings of Ice and Frost prior to Barbatos' arrival. Section 2, \"The Cultivation of Mondstadt,\" covers Mondstadt's ancestors, including the aristocrats' predecessors, in the period during which agriculture developed. Section 3, \"Tyrants, Heirs, and Rebels,\" covers the long reign of the Aristocracy in Mondstadt.\n\nThe reader may wish for this work to serve as a cautionary tale to future generations. In fact, it was compiled with no such ambition in mind. The freedom bestowed upon us by Barbatos is also the freedom that allows us to cast off the shackles of the past in search of the truth. My only hope is that this work, in a spirit of openness and truth, may finally share with the reader those stories which it was forbidden to share in the past.",
        "83": "May the gentle breeze of Barbatos carry words of enlightenment and deliver them into the gaze of my readers. And may the wind of freedom forever prevail in Mondstadt.\n\nThe story of the Gunnhildr Clan begins in legend, three thousand years ago during the war between the Lord of the Tower, Decarabian, and the King of the North Wind, Andrius. It was a time when Mondstadt was a frozen wasteland, and Gunnhildr was about to become the strongest leader her nomadic clan had ever seen.\n\nGunnhildr's father, the then-leader of the clan, had once served under Decarabian. He served until he found the despotic rule of the aloof and selfish king to be more than he could bear, whereupon he led his clan outside of the city where ferocious winds howled without mercy. But life in the wasteland beyond the city gates was harsh and unforgiving. Though they had escaped the wrath of a tyrant, they were now faced with the wrath of relentless and all-engulfing blizzards.\n\nJust when all hope seemed lost for the wandering clan, a spirit from the midst of the myriad winds heard Gunnhildr's prayers. The sincere plea of a clan chief's young daughter joined with a people's cry for help, a cry that the blizzard had all but drowned out, and became a faith. The faith gathered in front of the wind spirit like water flowing into a spring and became the source from which the wind spirit drew its power. The wind spirit used this power to make a small shelter for the clan, and bestowed upon the clan chief's daughter the power to protect.\n\nAfter her father's death, Gunnhildr took his place as the clan's leader. She also became its first priestess. From that day forth, she protected her clan faithfully. When the Anemo Archon Barbatos challenged the aloof and selfish king Decarabian's rule, Gunnhildr led her people to make a stand against the Archon's fury. But when Barbatos finally fought through the ferocious winds and freed the tyrant's subjects, she was also the one who decorated the victorious Anemo Archon with laurels.\n\nIn later times, after Barbatos had departed, a class of aristocrats emerged across the land. These rulers, who were possessed of divine power, would become corrupted and turn to tyranny themselves a thousand years later, but none had the ability to predict the distant future. Not even Barbatos himself.\n\nGunnhildr's descendants were themselves a prominent clan within the Aristocracy. But unlike the evil and scheming Lawrence Clan, the Gunnhildrs upheld their legacy of protecting Mondstadt that was enshrined in their motto, \"for Mondstadt, as always,\" doing everything within their power to protect its people. During the later struggle to overthrow the Aristocracy, they took the side of the people of Mondstadt. For this reason, they were spared the sentence of exile that was imposed on the rest of the Aristocracy.\n\nToday, the Gunnhildr Clan is a source of many brave knights and outstanding clergy members that serve in the Knights of Favonius. If history can teach us anything at all about the future, perhaps it is that the Gunnhildr Clan will continue honoring the legacy of its ancestors and its duty to the Anemo Archon: to protect Mondstadt, the land and all who inhabit it, forever.",

Thus were they returned to the cycle of Elements, which doth span both Heaven and Earth, and which knows no end. But some souls held on to their hatred and took on flesh once more as daemons. The daemons rose up in anger, giving rise to a miasma, which in turn engendered all manner of plagues, monsters and other perverse evils. They starved the earth and churned the waters, and wrought devastation on the people. Therefore, it is said: The daemonic is the shadow of the divine.\n\n\"Liyue suffered many outbreaks of disease in ancient times. Some say this was caused by the chaos of the relentless warring between gods. The defeated were squashed beneath the rocks of the earth, where they decomposed and became soil, and finally re-entered the everlasting elemental cycle. Some of the gods' souls were filled with bitterness at their fate, and refused to suffer it any longer. Their bitterness materialized and became evil monsters. The monsters' rage manifested itself in the form of diseases, monster infestations, and all kinds of other strange occurrences. The monsters ravaged the land and turned it into a wilderness, and unleashed all manner of evil upon the rivers and seas. They inflicted untold suffering on the people. Hence, what we call monsters are in fact physical manifestations of the resentment of gods defeated in war.\"\n\nRex Lapis summoned yakshas unto him to purge the daemons. Illuminated beasts of dreadful appearance and warlike temperament were they, and no brutality did they spare in their duty to defend. Of the many, five were the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. Wherever battle took Rex Lapis, so too did they follow, until the plague was purged. The five are known unto mortals as \"The Yakshas.\"\n\n\"Rex Lapis summoned yakshas to help him destroy the monsters. The yakshas were illuminated beasts of Liyue. Ferocious and intimidating to behold, they were violent by nature and formidable in battle, ready to kill mercilessly to defend Rex Lapis' rule. Among the yakshas, five were known as the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. The five followed Rex Lapis into battle countless times, finally wiping out the evil at its source. They became know throughout the world simply as 'The Yakshas'.\"\n\n\"The Yakshas\" were guardians of Rex Lapis for years without measure, and the evils they vanquished were incalculable. Yet, mighty though they were, beyond the torment that betide all who face war the yakshas were not, and they became afflicted. Some were given unto their rage, others unto a madness which fear mongered. Many turned to the slaughter of their own, others were bewitched by shadows of the soul. After a millennium did fate present itself unto them, and it was such: three of the five perished, the fourth vanished, and all of the myriad shared the fate of the three or the fourth. The fifth alone prevailed, and the fifth was Alatus.\n\n\"'The Yakshas' faithfully protected Rex Lapis and pacified all manner of catastrophes in the world. This continued for many years. But there came a day when the yakshas, despite their might, found that their deeds had taken their toll, and that the remnants of divine bitterness had begun to poison them. Some descended into a blind rage of a kind that cannot be put into words, or were driven by fear to equally indescribable madness. Some turned on and destroyed each other. Some were lost to delusions of the mind. After a thousand years' scourges, three of the five were slain, and one disappeared. Many other yakshas of unknown name also either died or fled. In the end, only one of the five, Alatus, survived.\"\n\nAlatus is the Golden-Winged King who is also the Conqueror of Demons. None knows whence he came, nor whither he went. Only at springtime, during the offering of lanterns at night, might the people see the glow at Guyun and declare: \"Behold, the Vigilant Yaksha ends the dominion of daemons!\" Or they might hear the sound of a flute amongst the marsh reeds, but find none who play the flute, and thus declare: \"Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland.\"\n\n\"Alatus is also known as the Golden-Winged King, or alternatively as the Conqueror of Demons. Nobody knows where he came from, and nobody knows where he went. In spring of each year, when the Lantern Rite festival arrives, Liyue people will gaze at the glow in the air above Guyun Stone Forest, and say: 'Behold, the Guardian Yaksha ends the dominion of demons.' Some hear a sound like a flute coming from Dihua Marsh, but when they enter the marsh there is no flutist to be found. They say: 'Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland.'\"\n\nThus, divine endowment doth carry with it that ultimate and unbreakable trial: to lose kin, friend, or ally, to face the impossibility of redemption, to burn in everlasting anger and know no respite. To become the foe of an ancient evil was to abandon hope of both reward and resolution in his endeavors, and his torment was that of the preta, which is to be without satiety after ten thousand fates.\n\n\"For this reason, it is said that the wages of being blessed with supernatural power is a destiny of hardship and eventual destruction. For the yaksha lost all his friends, family, and those he fought alongside. He built up an incalculable karmic debt from the violent deeds his life necessitated, and the consequence was a heart filled with darkness and hatred from which there was no rest. There was no reward to be gained from making an enemy of his own bitterness and hatred from the old days, nor was there any escape from the unbearable suffering. The torment ate away at his heart like an insatiable wolf, and an infinite number of lifetimes could have done nothing to reduce it.\"",

        "95": "—Pressing Official Business—\n\"I am the Great and Glorious General Weiyang, emissary of the imperial court on a royal mission! I demand that you step aside at once!\"\n\"General? So the Great and Glorious is a military rank now, huh? I thought it was a civil office.\" Mir responded with not a moment's hesitation.\nWeiyang's face turned bright red. \"Oh!? An ignorant borderland heathen seeks to educate me on the matters of the court!?\"\nMir was unfazed. \"I would be surprised if they'd overhauled the entire government bureaucracy in the space of a few years.\"\nTwo broad-sword-wielding Martial Artists in Weiyang's party burst out laughing. \"Haha! So ends our grand journey to the capital... The cart finally makes it past a thousand miles of checkpoints, only to get gridlocked like this at some tiny little inn out in the wilderness!\"\nThe waiter, Qin, stared intently at Weiyang's crimson-colored cheeks before suddenly declaring: \"You're a woman! A female officer disguised as a man!\" The claim was accentuated with a prod of his finger.\n\"An astute observation,\" came the response from one of the martial artists. \"She is in fact the Secretary of Ceremonies. The two of us are military officers. One from the Imperial Guards, the other from the Imperial Escorts, both versed in polearm and sword. We are serving the office of the Imperial Grand Minister on secondment, and we are here under orders to retrieve the Ominous Swords.\"\n\"Although the part about the Great and Glorious Gen... General, haha... Although that's made up, the bit about being here on official court... uh, business is not,\" the other Martial Artist chimed in to say.\n\nThe Ominous Swords were something that Mir had heard of. The story was that an iron meteorite had fallen from the sky five or six years ago, and convention dictated that as nature's treasure it belonged to the imperial family. However, a swordsmith by the name of Feng had taken it for himself and used it to illegally cast nine swords. It was said that the Ominous Swords were cursed by the meteorite and could drain people's intellect. Naturally, they had caused quite the stir in martial artists' circles.\n\n\"Good for you,\" said Mir as he shut the toilet door.\n\"It'd be even better for me if you got yourself out from that toilet... now!\" Her disguise exposed, Weiyang gave up trying to compose herself and spoke in her normal voice. She sounded more charming than one would expect, given the circumstances.\n\"Officer Weiyang is a cultured lady of the court. Unlike us, she cannot resolve her pressing official business by simply finding a discrete spot in the wild. Please, hurry up!\"\n\nMir washed his hands and exited the toilet, then sat down at the table with the two Martial Artists.\n\"It is not at every border town that we encounter one so familiar with court affairs.\" The one that seems to be the Imperial Escort officer sizes up Mir. \"Might I inquire as to your personal history?\"\n\"My father, Mi Tingren, was Minister of Imperial Banquets. He was framed for embezzlement of funds intended for the imperial cuisine. He then resigned from his post and returned home.\" Mir paused to scratch his chin before continuing, \"My old man's not been himself ever since it happened. I still intend to go back to the court one day and clear the Mi family name.\"",
        "96": "—A Matter of Possession—\n\"Yum. Very nice.\"\nNow that the spirit had possessed her body, Weiyang was of a much sweeter and gentler disposition. She took a tiny bite of one of Mir's stuffed pies, but it was too hot, so in an effort to avoid burning her tongue she stuck it out of her mouth and panted for breath frantically. Truth be told, it was all rather cute.\n\"That came unexpectedly. I need some time to process.\" Mir, who had given up one of his eyeballs to appease the spirit, helped himself to a pie and asked, \"Can you go over it again?\"\n\"Very well. The 'meteorite' was in fact a Divine Halberd. It was snapped into pieces by a commoner and made into nine cursed swords — the Ominous Swords. This one is the Sword of Mist, adding in that pair I've found three of them to date.\"\n\"And what's your place in all of this?\"\n\"I was once the daughter of the Celestial Emperor. But I have long forgotten my name. I was in charge of conducting trials and sentencing at the end — a judge, to use your parlance.\"\nSince the Court of Imperial Entertainments was responsible for sacrifices and offerings, Mir's father had forced him to learn every last detail and word uttered in every known court ritual. And because most rituals involved encounters with bizarre forces and temperamental deities, he also knew a thing or two about how to deal with them. For instance, he knew that deities tended to guard their names closely, for knowledge of a deity's true name allows a human being to exercise absolute control over them. So he wasn't convinced this one had simply forgotten her name.\n\n\"So the court wants to retrieve the swords to reconstruct the Divine Halberd?\" Mir forced himself to entertain the reasonability of this line of inquiry.\n\"I don't know. The master of this body knows nothing else. She is just... deeply angry. She wants to prove herself.\" Weiyang puts her hands on her chest.\n\"So what's the next step? Do I have to perform some sort of farewell ceremony for you?\" Mir stroked the bandaged and sightless eye. \"And then do I get my eye back?\"\n\n\"Give me a name.\" She raised her head, oblivious to the crumbs at the edges of her mouth.\n\"Don't be ridiculous. The imperial civil service examinations are overseen in person by the Emperor himself. How will I claim the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets with only one eye?\"\n\"Well, I have things to reclaim too: the remaining pieces of the Divine Halberd,\" she responded. \"Otherwise, this world and everything in it is going to burn in hellfire.\"\nMir kept looking at her, but did not respond.\n\"You do not need to go with me. But with the fate of all living things at stake, please allow me to hold on to your eyeball for the time being.\"",
        "97": "—A Dark Westward Journey—\n\"This is all that I can do for you,\" Mir said as he placed a series of dishes onto the table. He then sat down opposite Weiyang.\nWeiyang's right arm, which was broken in the fight to the death that had just taken place, was still wrapped in bandages. She stared intensely at Mir for a long while, but Mir just sat there resting his jaw on his hand and looking downwards. Neither of them spoke.\nFinally, Weiyang attempted to use chopsticks with her left hand. But alas, her dexterity was found wanting, and she failed to procure a single meatball from the murky depths of the hot broth.\nMir sighed, took the chopsticks from her hand, and said, \"Fine, I'll feed you.\"\n\"So there is still more that you can do for me,\" Weiyang suddenly quipped a few mouthfuls in. Her mood remained unchanged.\n\"The Court of Imperial Entertainments is dedicated to worshiping and making sacrifices to all of you divine beings up above. Serving you is my family's job.\"\nAnd in any case, when the gods make their move, what can mere mortals do but look on helplessly and accept their fate?\n— At least, that's what Mir thought. But he also thought it was better to keep that part to himself.\n\n\"Couldn't you use your powers, though? I thought you said that each time you fight a Ominous Sword owner, you use telekinesis to make your polearm levitate, swing your sword around, and so on. Surely chopsticks can't be any harder?\"\n\"That is a power bestowed upon me by my father. Only I have this power. It is solely for use in sentencing the guilty. I mustn't...\" Weiyang's voice changed in tone. \"I mustn't use it lightly.\"\n\"Before he died, that guy said something really strange about the situation with my father.\" Mir flicked the candle flame while he spoke to relieve his boredom. \"'Minister Mi was neither innocent, nor wrongly accused.' What on earth did he mean by that?\"\nIf the court was unwilling to reconstruct the Divine Halberd, then being with the celestial emperor's daughter that had possessed Weiyang's body makes him an enemy of the imperial court.\nAs if to signal that she had understood what Mir was thinking, Weiyang's face grew dark in the candlelight.\nShe said, \"You don't need to help me any longer. You are a mere mortal, there is nothing to be gained from settling a score with the court.\"\nMir replied, \"Speak no more of this matter. I must get the truth out of my old man first.\"\nWeiyang said, \"Oh... We will pay a visit to your esteemed father? Then I must buy some fresh silk garments and makeup first thing tomorrow morning.\"\nMir replied, \"He's just a regular old man. There's no need for all that.\"\nAn unusually stern expression appeared on Weiyang's face. \"Is this not your sworn duty?\"",
        "98": "—Master Plan—\nEven a Buddha or an adeptus would have found themselves powerless to do anything in this situation.\n\"This is the Sword of Flame, the 'Katakugosha.' It was made from the shard of the Divine Halberd that was the Dharani of the fire realm. Sorry... in language that Your Majesty would understand, it's made with the runes of the fire realm, one of the God King's nine realms.\"\nHow could this westbound warrior display such mastery of the sword? Most who had been stripped of their intellect by an Ominous Sword lose their fighting instinct and any martial arts they had learned.\nWeiyang nursed her broken arm and panted in the scorching hot air. Normally her abilities would enable her to fix broken bones, but the unquenchable flames burnt relentlessly at her wound.\nHer sight grew blurry as she lost blood. Mir stepped in front of her, guarding her from the warrior.\n\"I can see that you have a lot of questions. Fine, I'll tell you everything! I killed your father because he tried to stop the resurrection of the God King. And the reason I can manipulate the fire realm runes rather than the other way round is because...\"\nThe warrior from the east raised the Ominous Sword. \"Is because I am a warrior of Hunt From Above made flesh...\"\nLegend has it that the Celestial Emperor once went to war with the Asura. To prepare for the war, the Celestial Emperor selected soldiers from three realms and made them ascend to become his celestial army after death. Sometimes, they were beset by inclement weather on the marsh, with thundercloud tornadoes surrounding them. The people of Zhongzhou referred to it as the soldiers of the celestial army \"hunting from above.\"\n\n\"No... Impossible!\" A look of disbelief appeared on the warrior's face as the Ominous Sword broke into pieces, and he, too, was sent flying from his own shoulders towards whatever destiny had in store for him next.\nIn the chaos, Mir had brought out the sword his father had left him as inheritance. It was intended as more of a gesture of defiance than a genuine attempt to fight back. But unbeknownst to him, this was the greatest cursed sword of all, that had once burned the entire world to cinders: Laevatain. If the fire-realm runes constituted the mystery of the fire realm, Laevatain was its pure, unadulterated, unquenchable reality.\nThe sword had extinguished after the world was burned, but having assimilated the rune of the fire realm, it burned bright once more.\n\n\"The whole world... destroyed again...\" Weiyang fell unconscious as she spoke.",
        "99": "—Legacy of a Goddess—\n\"Your deeds have saved the people. You are indeed a great warrior.\" The crown prince, hands clasped behind his back, walked in circles around Mir, who lay prostrate on the ground.\nBut Mir was unmoved by his words.\n\"Hand over the Divine Halberd and you may have the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets. Grand Secretary will be yours too within a decade, if you want it.\" The crown prince sat down. \"Well? What is your response?\"\n\"A lowly commoner dares not speak till His Majesty permits him to rise.\"\n\"Hmm... but now if I granted you permission to speak, it would be because you had instructed me to do so... We can't have that! As future lord of all the land—\"\n\"Pff. What a charade this is,\" said Mir as he switched to a more relaxed position. \"The official etiquette of the ruling dynasty does not require kowtowing for an audience with the crown prince. It should just be the regular thrice greeting. I noticed that you were on track to become Emperor, so I thought I'd come and pay my respects. There's just no need to lord it over me like this.\"\n\"You... you...\"\n\"What about me?\" Mir snapped as he stood up. \"I will give you half of the Divine Halberd. The Dharani of the fire realm, I will offer to father. Mostly to avoid another situation where we have remnants trying to stir up trouble.\"\n\"Can't, uh, can't hurt. As long as the portion I get looks the part it'll be fine. This is gonna be known as the new national superweapon! Hahaha...\"\nMir sat down impatiently right in front of the crown prince. \"I don't understand how you are such a fool when we were both raised on the same mother's milk!\"\n\"How dare you! I have nothing but respect for Lady Mi serving as my wet nurse. And it's only because of the virtues she instilled in me that I am able to put up with your—\"\n\"Give the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets to someone who cares. I'm going home.\"\nThe crown prince said nothing.\n\"How about Weiyang?\" Mir chewed his food and acted nonchalant.\n\"Oh, for the meritorious act of retrieving the swords, she was promoted to Secretary of Ceremonies. She was not implicated in the evil plot by her father, the Imperial Grand Minister. The Minister of Ceremonies and the Grand Secretary both testified. I will see her every need is met.\"\nSomething sounded odd about that.\nBut that was fine.\n\nShe was gone, and his eye was restored. But to this day there was still a dull ache, like the phantom pain of a missing limb.",
        "9": "Having failed to catch the fox, I went to sleep with only tasteless boiled carrots in my stomach. If not for what happened next, I would have forgotten about the fox by now.\nI awoke with a start to strange noises coming from outside my door.\n\"Perhaps boars have come to eat my carrots?\"\nI hopped out of bed and opened my door. To my surprise, there stood a tiny little white fox. Its fur was so white that it glowed in the dark, not unlike the way sunlight sparkles on water after filtering through the treetops.\n\"This must be the same fox from earlier!\"\nI thought again of those eyes that looked like gemstones in the water, gazing at me as if from the depths of my heart.\nAnd so I walked over to the fox, unarmed and with tired eyes.\nThis time it stayed still and waited for me in silence.\nThe closer I drew, the greater in stature it became.\nBy the time I stood before it, it had magically transformed into a human.\nShe was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water — in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops.\n\"What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.\"\nI thought to myself.\n\"This can't be. Must be some type of fox magic.\"\nStranger still, the idea of \"fox magic\" had only occurred to me in that instant. You'd believe anything after you'd seen those eyes.\nFor all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the dead of night.\nAnd at last she spoke. Though not in our common tongue, I could somehow understand her. Some other magic, perhaps.\n\"I would have died by that lake, if you had not come in my hour of need.\"\nShe paused and continued:\n\"Although to die by that gemstone lake is no bad thing,\"\n\"We foxes are grateful beings, so you must let me return the favor.\"\nShe bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams."

He searched everywhere, until he became involved in a mining accident.\nWhile trapped in the cave, his eyes perceived nothing but an all-engulfing and profoundly disorienting darkness. His ears rang with the thunderous crashing of rocks, as if the foundations of the world itself were caving in.\nIn the aftermath of this ordeal, the craftsman's furnace lay unused.

He was certain that it was his trip into the mine that had disturbed the dragon from underground and the meteorite from the heavens. He forced himself up from his sickbed, lit the fires of the furnace once more and forged a mighty broadsword.\nWhen it was ready, Han Ce took the sword into the mine shaft. There, on instructions from his father, he erected a shrine as tall as himself and placed the sword inside to ward off evil and rebuke the dragon.\n\nHan Wu died peacefully in his sleep several years later.\nAt the moment of Han Wu's death, a traveler passing by the mine shaft at Mt. Tianheng saw a crimson light shining out from somewhere within the rocks. As the traveler watched on, a hidden shrine appeared and slowly opened.\nThe broadsword inside the shrine shone faintly, as if weeping with bereavement.\nHan Ce went into the mountains that very night to retrieve the blade.\nThe Tianshu of that age personally engraved an inscription upon the blade:\n\"Carves open mountains and tears through the seas, shreds apart clouds and splits the moon.\"\n",
