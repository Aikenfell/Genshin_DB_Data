Its bronze surface sparkled in the bright starlight.\nUrban legends tell of a collector of curios wearing black robes, who roamed the market streets one day, buying up Orichalceous Time-Dials and paying a generous sum for each one.\nSome sellers queried him, curious to know what his reasons were, but he deftly deflected all their questions with an array of excuses and other verbal tricks.\nAs for what this individual's true motive was, perhaps only the unyielding forward march of time can finally deliver a satisfying explanation.\n",

These soldiers became known as the Millelith.\n\nThey would go on to take up arms with a yaksha in battle, fighting from the rearguard. They too drank from that golden cup.\nIt was a final toast to the benevolent and majestic Lord of Geo. With their gaze fixed ahead of them, they stormed into the abyss.\nHundreds of years later, a conceited adventurer retrieved the cup from the depths of The Chasm and washed away the imperfections.\nMiraculously, the cup remained whole and untarnished by the passage of time. The pitch-dark of that subterranean realm had failed to remove its radiance.\n\nYet more centuries passed. Eventually, the people of Liyue would tell tales of an era of catastrophe and a nameless yaksha,\nTales of how heroes from disparate heritages and different lands united under a single banner against the Abyss...\nInevitably, the tale would touch upon the cup, and how the blood of those that went before remained clear and spotless as the day it was spilled.\n",
